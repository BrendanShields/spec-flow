# Feature: Navi System Optimization and Refactoring

## Overview

Comprehensive assessment and optimization of the Flow specification-driven development system, including:
- Renaming from "Flow" to "Navi" throughout the system
- Restructuring directory from `.flow/` to `__specification__/`
- Improving efficiency, reducing complexity, and enhancing user experience
- Eliminating redundancies and optimizing token usage
- Maximizing parallel processing capabilities
- Simplifying documentation structure

## User Stories

### P1 - Must Have (Core Refactoring)

- [ ] **US1**: As a developer, I want the system renamed from "Flow" to "Navi" so that it has a clearer, more distinctive identity
  - **Given** the current system is called Flow
  - **When** all references, commands, and documentation are updated
  - **Then** the system should be consistently branded as Navi

- [ ] **US2**: As a developer, I want the `.flow/` directory renamed to `__specification__/` so that it's more descriptive and won't conflict with other tools
  - **Given** artifacts are currently stored in `.flow/`
  - **When** the directory is renamed and all references updated
  - **Then** all functionality should work with `__specification__/` directory

- [ ] **US3**: As a developer, I want redundant documentation files consolidated so that there's a single source of truth
  - **Given** architecture-blueprint.md and ARCHITECTURE.md duplicate content
  - **When** these are consolidated into a single `architecture.md` (lowercase)
  - **Then** there should be no duplicate documentation
  - **Given** PRODUCT-REQUIREMENTS.md exists
  - **When** renamed to `requirements.md` (lowercase)
  - **Then** all generated markdown files should use lowercase naming

- [ ] **US4**: As a developer, I want unnecessary commands removed so that the system is simpler to understand
  - **Given** CLAUDE-FLOW and COMMANDS files exist
  - **When** their functionality is already covered by skills and .claude/
  - **Then** these files should be removed to reduce redundancy

### P2 - Should Have (Efficiency Improvements)

- [ ] **US5**: As a developer, I want token-efficient prompts so that costs are minimized and responses are faster
  - **Given** current prompts may be verbose
  - **When** prompts are analyzed and optimized
  - **Then** token usage should be reduced by at least 30% without losing functionality
  - {CLARIFY: What's the current average token usage per skill?}

- [ ] **US6**: As a developer, I want parallel processing maximized so that tasks complete faster
  - **Given** some operations run sequentially that could run in parallel
  - **When** independent operations are identified and parallelized
  - **Then** overall execution time should decrease significantly
  - {CLARIFY: Which specific operations should be parallelized?}

- [ ] **US7**: As a developer, I want cognitive complexity reduced so that the system is easier to use
  - **Given** users may need to remember multiple commands
  - **When** commands are consolidated and simplified
  - **Then** users should need fewer commands to achieve the same results

- [ ] **US8**: As a developer, I want DRY principles applied throughout so that maintenance is easier
  - **Given** there may be duplicated logic across skills
  - **When** common functionality is extracted to shared utilities
  - **Then** code duplication should be minimized

### P3 - Nice to Have (Enhanced Features)

- [ ] **US9**: As a developer, I want intelligent command routing so that I don't need to specify exact commands
  - **Given** users currently need to use specific commands
  - **When** natural language understanding is improved
  - **Then** the system should infer intent from context

- [ ] **US10**: As a developer, I want automatic memory optimization so that context usage is minimized
  - **Given** memory files may accumulate unnecessary data
  - **When** intelligent pruning and compression is implemented
  - **Then** memory usage should be optimized automatically

- [ ] **US11**: As a developer, I want progress visualization so that I can see workflow status at a glance
  - **Given** status is currently text-based
  - **When** visual progress indicators are added
  - **Then** workflow progress should be immediately apparent

## Success Criteria

1. **Renaming Complete**: All references to "Flow" updated to "Navi"
2. **Directory Migration**: `.flow/` successfully migrated to `__specification__/`
3. **Documentation Consolidated**: No duplicate documentation files
4. **Token Reduction**: At least 30% reduction in average token usage
5. **Parallel Processing**: Key operations run in parallel where possible
6. **Command Simplification**: Reduced number of commands needed for common tasks
7. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing projects continue to work with migration path
8. **User Satisfaction**: Reduced cognitive load and improved user experience

## Technical Constraints

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Must provide migration path for existing Flow projects
2. **Git History**: Preserve git history during directory rename
3. **MCP Integration**: Maintain compatibility with MCP servers
4. **Cross-platform**: Must work on macOS, Linux, and Windows
5. **Performance**: Refactoring should not degrade performance
6. **Documentation**: All changes must be thoroughly documented

## Clarifications Needed

1. {CLARIFY: Should we maintain aliases for old commands during transition period?}
2. {CLARIFY: How should we handle existing .flow directories in user projects?}
3. {CLARIFY: What's the migration timeline for existing users?}
4. {CLARIFY: Should the `/flow` command become `/navi`?}
5. {CLARIFY: Which parallel processing opportunities are highest priority?}

## Assessment Areas

### Current System Analysis
- Command usage patterns and redundancies
- Token consumption by skill/command
- Sequential operations that could be parallel
- Documentation duplications and gaps
- User journey friction points
- Memory utilization patterns

### Optimization Targets
1. **Command Consolidation**
   - Merge similar commands
   - Remove unused commands
   - Simplify command syntax

2. **Prompt Optimization**
   - Remove verbose instructions
   - Use concise, clear language
   - Eliminate redundant context

3. **Parallel Processing**
   - File operations (read/write/edit)
   - Independent skill executions
   - Research and analysis tasks

4. **Documentation Structure**
   - Single source of truth
   - Clear hierarchy
   - Lowercase naming convention
   - Minimal but complete

5. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Intelligent context pruning
   - Compression of historical data
   - Relevant information retrieval

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Assessment and Planning
   - Analyze current usage patterns
   - Identify optimization opportunities
   - Create detailed migration plan

2. **Phase 2**: Core Refactoring
   - Rename Flow → Navi
   - Migrate .flow/ → __specification__/
   - Consolidate documentation

3. **Phase 3**: Optimization
   - Implement parallel processing
   - Optimize prompts and tokens
   - Simplify command structure

4. **Phase 4**: Testing and Migration
   - Test with existing projects
   - Provide migration tools
   - Update all documentation

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Breaking Changes**: Provide compatibility layer
2. **User Confusion**: Clear migration guide and documentation
3. **Performance Regression**: Comprehensive testing before release
4. **Data Loss**: Backup and migration tools
5. **Integration Issues**: Test all MCP integrations

## Deliverables

1. Optimized Navi system with new directory structure
2. Migration tool for existing Flow projects
3. Updated documentation (all lowercase .md files)
4. Performance metrics showing improvements
5. User guide for new Navi commands
6. Backward compatibility layer (optional based on decision)
