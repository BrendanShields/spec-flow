# Claude Code Marketplace

An internal marketplace for Claude Code plugins.

## 🚀 Overview

The Claude Code Marketplace is a **Skills-first** architecture that replaces traditional command-based interactions with intelligent, context-aware Skills powered by AI. No backward compatibility baggage - just add a new skill and the flow will adapt.

### Key Innovations (v3.0 - Production Ready!)

- **🧠 AI-Powered Skills**: Natural language understanding with intent detection
- **🎯 Intelligent Orchestration**: Complete workflows with `flow:orchestrate`
- **🔍 Intent Detection**: Claude suggests appropriate skills automatically
- **💾 Session Continuity**: Resume workflows exactly where you left off
- **🚀 Progressive Disclosure**: 80% reduction in context usage
- **🪝 7 Comprehensive Hooks**: Validation, formatting, status tracking
- **🤖 Restructured Subagents**: Optimized for parallel execution
- **📊 Real-time Progress**: Track workflow status throughout execution
- **✨ Auto-formatting**: Code quality without manual intervention

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Claude automatically detects your intent and suggests skills!

# Option 1: Complete automation (NEW!)
"Build a real-time collaborative document editor"
# → Claude detects intent and suggests flow:orchestrate
# → Executes complete workflow automatically

# Option 2: Traditional skill invocation
flow:init                # Initialize Flow project
flow:orchestrate         # Run complete workflow end-to-end

# Option 3: Step-by-step execution
flow:specify "Build a document editor"  # Generate spec
flow:plan                               # Create technical plan
flow:tasks                              # Generate task list
flow:implement                          # Execute implementation

# The AI adapts to your working style!
```

## 🎪 The Flow Plugin: Specification-Driven Development Reimagined

Flow is our flagship plugin that demonstrates the full power of the Skills architecture.

```

### Updated Architecture (v2.0)

Flow now uses a **blueprint-first, flat artifact model** with optional JIRA integration:

#### Directory Structure
```
.flow/                          # Project-level artifacts (flat peer model)
├── product-requirements.md     # Project-level PRD (WHAT to build)
├── architecture-blueprint.md   # Technical standards (HOW to build)
├── contracts/openapi.yaml      # API contracts (if API project)
└── data-models/entities.md     # Domain entities

features/001-feature-name/      # Sequential naming
├── spec.md                     # Feature spec (with JIRA frontmatter)
├── plan.md                     # Implementation plan
└── tasks.md                    # Task breakdown
```

#### Key Concepts
- **Flat Peer Model**: All `.flow/` artifacts are peers - no strict hierarchy
- **Blueprint**: Architecture and guidance
- **JIRA Integration**: Bidirectional sync - start from JIRA or local
- **User Approval**: Always asks before syncing TO JIRA or modifying `.flow/` files
- **Traceability**: JIRA ID in frontmatter, prepended to git branch

#### JIRA Integration Workflows
```bash
# Start from JIRA story
flow:specify "https://jira.company.com/browse/PROJ-123"

# Start locally, optionally create JIRA story
flow:specify "Add user authentication"  # Asks: Create JIRA story?

# Bidirectional sync
flow:sync --to-jira      # Push local changes to JIRA (asks first)
flow:sync --from-jira PROJ-123  # Pull JIRA updates (shows diff, asks)
```

### Flow Skills (Enhanced with Smart Triggers!)

| Skill | When It Triggers Automatically | Key Features |
|-------|--------------------------------|--------------|
| `flow:orchestrate` 🆕 | "Build/create complete project" | Executes entire workflow end-to-end |
| `flow:specify` | "Create/add/build a feature" | Domain detection, JIRA sync, smart defaults |
| `flow:blueprint` | "Define architecture/tech stack" | Technical standards & patterns |
| `flow:plan` | "How to implement/technical design" | Architecture decisions, technology evaluation |
| `flow:implement` | "Build/code/implement this" | Parallel execution, error recovery |
| `flow:analyze` | "Check consistency/validate" | Cross-artifact validation |
| `flow:discover` 🆕 | "Understand existing project/backlog" | JIRA analysis, codebase discovery |
| `flow:metrics` 🆕 | "Show AI vs human code metrics" | Generation analytics, ROI tracking |

**NEW**: Skills now have specific "Use when:" descriptions for better discovery!

### Example: Three Ways to Work

#### 🚀 Method 1: Full Automation (NEW!)
```bash
# Just describe what you want - Claude handles EVERYTHING
"Create a SaaS platform for team collaboration"

# Claude will:
# 1. Detect intent → Suggest flow:orchestrate
# 2. Run complete workflow automatically
# 3. Initialize → Blueprint → Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement
# 4. Track progress with visual updates
# 5. Save state for session continuity
```

#### 🎯 Method 2: Intent-Based (NEW!)
```bash
# Natural language - Claude suggests the right skill
"I need to add user authentication"
# → Claude suggests: flow:specify

"How should I architect this?"
# → Claude suggests: flow:plan

"Check if everything is consistent"
# → Claude suggests: flow:analyze
```

#### 📝 Method 3: Direct Skills
```bash
# Traditional approach - call skills directly
flow:specify "User authentication with OAuth"
flow:plan
flow:tasks
flow:implement
```

## 🤖 Subagents: Autonomous Execution

### Flow Subagents

#### 🔍 Flow-Analyzer
Performs deep codebase analysis:
- Pattern extraction
- Architecture discovery
- Constitution inference
- Brownfield project understanding

#### ⚙️ Flow-Implementer
Executes implementation autonomously:
- Parallel task execution
- Intelligent error recovery
- Test-driven development
- Real-time progress tracking

#### 🔬 Flow-Researcher
Conducts technical research:
- Best practices discovery
- Library evaluation
- Decision documentation
- Risk assessment

### Subagent Execution

```javascript
// Subagents work in parallel for maximum efficiency
await Promise.all([
  invokeAgent('flow-researcher', { topic: 'real-time-frameworks' }),
  invokeAgent('flow-analyzer', { scope: 'existing-codebase' }),
  invokeAgent('flow-implementer', { tasks: taskList, parallel: true })
]);
```

## 🪝 Hooks: Comprehensive Automation (7 Hooks!)

### NEW Hook System Features (8 Hooks!)

| Hook | Purpose | When It Runs |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **detect-intent.js** | Suggests appropriate Flow skills | On every user prompt |
| **validate-prerequisites.js** | Ensures workflow requirements | Before skill execution |
| **format-code.js** | Auto-formats all code | After file modifications |
| **update-workflow-status.js** | Tracks progress | After each skill |
| **track-metrics.js** 🆕 | Tracks AI vs human code metrics | After file operations |
| **save-session.js** | Saves workflow state | At session end |
| **restore-session.js** | Restores previous state | At session start |
| **aggregate-results.js** | Combines parallel results | After sub-agents |

### Example: Intent Detection in Action
```bash
User: "I want to build a new feature"
System: 🎯 Detected intent: flow:specify
        Consider using: flow:specify

User: "Check if everything looks good"
System: 🎯 Detected intent: flow:analyze
        Consider using: flow:analyze
```

### Example: Session Continuity
```bash
# Day 1
flow:specify "E-commerce platform"
flow:plan
# [User exits]

# Day 2
# [User returns]
System: 🔄 Session Restored
        Last session: 18 hours ago
        Feature: 001-ecommerce
        Tasks: 5/20 complete (25%)

        📝 Suggestions:
        • Continue working on: 001-ecommerce
        • Next workflow step: flow:tasks
```
