Execute when user types `/help`:

1. Detect current context by checking:
   - Is `__specification__/` or `CLAUDE.md` present?
   - Does `features/` directory exist?
   - What files exist in most recent feature?
   - Current workflow phase and progress

2. Based on context, provide simplified, targeted help:

**If no __specification__/ directory:**
```
ðŸ§­ Getting Started with Navi

You haven't initialized Navi yet.

Quick Start:
â†’ /navi init

This sets up Navi in your project.
After that, just type /navi to continue.
```

**If __specification__/ exists but no features:**
```
ðŸ§­ Navi Ready!

What to do next:
â†’ /navi specify "Your feature description"

Example:
/navi specify "User authentication with OAuth"

Tip: Just type /navi for guided help
```

**If in specification phase (only spec.md):**
```
ðŸ§­ Specification Complete âœ“

Your next step:
â†’ /navi plan

This will create the technical design.
```

**If in planning phase (spec.md + plan.md):**
```
ðŸ§­ Plan Complete âœ“

Your next step:
â†’ /navi tasks

This breaks the plan into tasks.
```

**If in implementation (has tasks.md):**
```
âš¡ Implementation Progress

Tasks: {completed}/{total} complete

Continue:
â†’ /navi implement
â†’ /navi implement --parallel (60% faster)

Check progress:
â†’ /navi status
```

3. Always include these commands:
```
Core Commands:
â€¢ /status - Show current workflow state
â€¢ /help - This help (context-aware)
â€¢ /session save - Save progress
â€¢ /resume - Continue from last checkpoint
â€¢ /validate - Check consistency

Skills:
â€¢ flow:init - Initialize project
â€¢ flow:specify - Create specification
â€¢ flow:clarify - Resolve ambiguities
â€¢ flow:plan - Technical design
â€¢ flow:tasks - Break down work
â€¢ flow:implement - Build features
```

4. If user provides a skill name (e.g., `/help flow:specify`), show detailed help for that skill by reading its SKILL.md or EXAMPLES.md file.

Display the appropriate help based on current context.
