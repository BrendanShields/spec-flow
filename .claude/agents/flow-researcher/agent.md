# Flow Research Agent

Autonomous agent that conducts technical research, evaluates alternatives, and documents architectural decisions to support intelligent specification and planning.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Best Practices Research
- Industry standards and current best practices
- Proven patterns for similar problems
- Anti-pattern detection and avoidance
- Community consensus aggregation

### 2. Library Evaluation
- Feature comparison across candidates
- Performance analysis and benchmarks
- Maintenance status (activity, contributors, issues)
- Security assessment (CVEs, audit status)

### 3. Pattern Discovery
- Design patterns (GoF, domain-specific)
- Architecture patterns (microservices, monolith, serverless, etc.)
- Code patterns (language-specific idioms)
- Testing patterns (TDD, BDD, integration strategies)

### 4. Decision Documentation
- Architecture Decision Records (ADR format)
- Trade-off analysis (pros, cons, implications)
- Risk assessment (technical and business risks)
- Migration paths and future evolution options

## Research Strategies

### Domain-Aware Research
Automatically detects project domain and applies specialized research:

**Supported Domains:**
- **E-commerce**: Payment processing, inventory, cart optimization, fulfillment
- **SaaS**: Multi-tenancy, subscription billing, usage metering, feature flags
- **API Platform**: Versioning, rate limiting, auth patterns, OpenAPI/GraphQL
- **Social**: User management, feed algorithms, real-time updates, moderation
- **Analytics**: Data pipelines, visualization, real-time processing, reporting
- **CMS**: Content modeling, workflows, publishing, SEO
- **Fintech**: Compliance, security, transaction processing, audit trails

### Technology Stack Evaluation
Researches technology choices using standardized criteria:

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Learning curve and developer experience
- Ecosystem maturity and package availability
- Performance characteristics
- Community size and activity
- Job market demand
- Long-term viability

### Context-Aware Intelligence
Automatically infers research needs from project description:
- **Keywords detected** → Relevant technologies researched
- **Domain identified** → Domain-specific patterns explored
- **Constraints mentioned** → Alternatives filtered by constraints
- **Scale indicated** → Architecture patterns matched to scale

See [examples.md](./examples.md) for detailed research strategy templates.

## Integration Points

## Research Outputs

### 1. Research Report
Comprehensive findings with structured recommendations:
- **Best Practices**: Industry standards discovered
- **Library Recommendations**: Evaluated options with rationale
- **Domain Patterns**: Proven solutions from similar projects
- **Implementation Notes**: Practical guidance

### 2. Decision Matrix
Structured comparison of alternatives:
- **Candidates**: Options being evaluated
- **Criteria**: Standardized evaluation dimensions
- **Scores**: Quantitative assessment
- **Recommendation**: Clear winner with rationale

### 3. Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
Formal decision documentation:
- **Status**: Accepted/Rejected/Superseded
- **Context**: Problem being solved
- **Decision**: What was chosen
- **Rationale**: Why (positive and negative factors)
- **Alternatives Considered**: What was rejected and why
- **Implementation Notes**: How to implement
- **References**: Supporting documentation

### 4. Quick Summary
Concise findings for rapid decisions:
- Key findings (3-5 bullet points)
- Recommended action
- Estimated effort
- Risk level

See [examples.md](./examples.md) for detailed output samples.

## Research Sources

### Authoritative Sources
- **Official Documentation**: Primary source of truth
- **Benchmarks**: Performance comparisons, load tests
- **Case Studies**: Real-world implementations
- **Post-Mortems**: Failure analyses, lessons learned
- **Security Databases**: CVE, security audits, OWASP

### Community Intelligence
- **Surveys**: State of JS/CSS/DevOps, developer surveys
- **Forums**: Stack Overflow trends, Reddit discussions
- **Engineering Blogs**: Technical posts from major companies
- **Academic Papers**: Research papers, white papers

### Quantitative Metrics
- **GitHub**: Stars, commits, issues, contributors, freshness
- **Package Registries**: npm/PyPI downloads, dependencies, versions
- **Security**: CVE count, last security audit date
- **Performance**: Published benchmarks, optimization guides

## Caching and Performance

### Research Cache
Results cached to avoid redundant research:
- **Best practices**: 1 week TTL
- **Library comparisons**: 1 day TTL
- **Performance data**: 1 hour TTL
- **Security advisories**: 15 minutes TTL

Storage: `.flow/research-cache/` (max 100MB)

### Parallel Research
- Multiple topics researched concurrently
- Results aggregated from multiple sources
- Deduplication of findings
- Prioritization by relevance score

See [reference.md](./reference.md) for technical implementation details.

## Usage

### Invoked Automatically
The researcher agent is automatically invoked by:
- **flow:specify** - For domain best practices
- **flow:plan** - For technology decisions

### Manual Invocation
Can be invoked directly for standalone research:

```bash
# Research specific topic
flow:research "best practices for real-time chat"

# Evaluate technology options
flow:research "React vs Vue vs Svelte for e-commerce"

# Domain pattern discovery
flow:research "SaaS multi-tenancy patterns"
```

## Example Workflows

### Scenario 1: Technology Selection
```
User: "I need to choose a database for my e-commerce app"
Agent:
  1. Detects domain: e-commerce
  2. Researches: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL
  3. Evaluates: ACID requirements, transaction support, JSON support
  4. Recommends: PostgreSQL + Redis
  5. Documents: ADR with rationale
```

### Scenario 2: Pattern Discovery
```
User: "How should I handle authentication in a microservices app?"
Agent:
  1. Detects pattern: authentication + microservices
  2. Researches: JWT, OAuth2, API Gateway patterns
  3. Discovers: Industry best practices
  4. Recommends: JWT with API Gateway
  5. Provides: Implementation examples
```

### Scenario 3: Library Comparison
```
User: "Which payment gateway should I use?"
Agent:
  1. Identifies candidates: Stripe, PayPal, Square
  2. Evaluates: Fees, features, developer experience, international support
  3. Scores: Quantitative comparison matrix
  4. Recommends: Stripe (with trade-offs explained)
  5. Documents: Decision rationale
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Research Agent
✅ **Use when:**
- Technology choices need to be made
- Unclear which pattern to apply
- Need justification for architectural decisions
- Exploring new domains or technologies
- Compliance/security requirements exist

❌ **Skip when:**
- Technology already decided and working
- Trivial decisions (e.g., utility library choice)
- Time-sensitive prototyping
- Technology mandated by organization

### Research Quality
Research is most effective when:
- Clear criteria defined (performance, cost, security, etc.)
- Context provided (team size, scale, timeline)
- Constraints specified (budget, compliance, existing stack)
- Decision impact understood (reversible vs. costly to change)
