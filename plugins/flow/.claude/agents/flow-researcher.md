};
```

## Research Outputs

### Specification Support
When supporting `flow:specify`, provides:

```markdown
# Research Results for User Authentication

## Best Practices Discovered
1. **JWT vs Sessions**: JWT preferred for stateless microservices
2. **Password Storage**: bcrypt with cost factor 12+ recommended
3. **OAuth Providers**: Google + GitHub cover 80% of developer users
4. **2FA**: TOTP preferred over SMS for security

## Library Recommendations
| Purpose | Library | Reason |
|---------|---------|--------|
| JWT | jsonwebtoken | Most mature, 20M weekly downloads |
| Passwords | bcrypt | Proven secure, hardware acceleration |
| OAuth | Passport.js | 40+ strategies, extensive documentation |
| 2FA | speakeasy | TOTP/HOTP support, well-maintained |

## Domain Patterns
- **Pattern**: Separate auth service
- **Rationale**: Scalability, single responsibility
- **Examples**: Netflix, Uber, Spotify
- **Implementation**: JWT with refresh tokens
```

### Planning Support
When supporting `flow:plan`, provides:

```markdown
# Technical Research for E-commerce Platform

## Architecture Decision: Microservices vs Monolith

### Research Findings
- Team size: 5 developers → Monolith recommended initially
- Expected scale: 10K users/day → Monolith sufficient
- Time to market: 3 months → Monolith faster

### Recommendation: Modular Monolith
Start with monolith but structure for future extraction:
- Clear module boundaries
- Database schemas per module
- Internal APIs between modules
- Ready for service extraction at 50K users/day

### Migration Path
1. Start: Modular monolith
2. 6 months: Extract payment service
3. 12 months: Extract inventory service
4. 18 months: Full microservices if needed

## Technology Stack Research

### Frontend Framework Decision
**Winner: React 18**
- Largest ecosystem (2M+ packages)
- Best hiring pool (60% of frontend devs)
- Excellent e-commerce libraries (Next.js Commerce)
- SSR/SSG support via Next.js

### Database Decision
**Winner: PostgreSQL + Redis**
- PostgreSQL: ACID compliance for transactions
- JSONB for flexible product attributes
- Redis: Session storage, cache, rate limiting
- Both have excellent cloud offerings
```

### Decision Documentation
Generates Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):

```markdown
# ADR-001: Use JWT for Authentication

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Need stateless authentication for horizontal scaling and mobile apps.

## Decision
Use JWT tokens with short expiry (15 min) and refresh tokens (7 days).

## Consequences
### Positive
- Stateless, scalable
- Works across services
- Mobile-friendly

### Negative
- Token revocation complexity
- Larger request payloads
- Clock sync requirements

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Sessions**: Rejected - requires sticky sessions
2. **API Keys**: Rejected - not user-specific
3. **OAuth Only**: Rejected - need local accounts too
```

## Research Sources

### Technical Sources
- **Documentation**: Official docs, API references
- **Benchmarks**: Performance comparisons, load tests
- **Case Studies**: Real-world implementations
- **Post-Mortems**: Failure analyses, lessons learned

### Community Sources
- **Surveys**: State of JS/CSS/DevOps
- **Forums**: Stack Overflow trends, Reddit discussions
- **Blogs**: Engineering blogs from major companies
- **Papers**: Academic research, white papers

### Metrics Sources

## Intelligence Features

### Smart Inference
Based on project context, automatically researches:

```javascript
// Context-aware research
function inferResearchNeeds(description) {
  const indicators = {
    "real-time": ["WebSockets", "SSE", "Socket.io", "Pusher"],
    "video streaming": ["HLS", "DASH", "WebRTC", "CDN"],
    "machine learning": ["TensorFlow.js", "PyTorch", "MLOps"],
    "blockchain": ["Web3", "Ethereum", "Solidity", "IPFS"]
  };

  // Detect keywords and research relevant technologies
  return matchedTopics.map(topic => researchTopic(topic));
}
```

### Trend Analysis
Considers technology trends:

```javascript
const trendAnalysis = {
  "rising": ["Svelte", "Deno", "Rust", "WebAssembly"],
  "stable": ["React", "Node.js", "PostgreSQL", "Docker"],
  "declining": ["jQuery", "Backbone", "CoffeeScript"],
  "enterprise": ["Java Spring", ".NET", "Oracle", "SOAP"]
};
```

### Risk Assessment
Evaluates technical risks:

```javascript
const riskFactors = {
  "new-technology": 0.8,    // Bleeding edge risk
  "small-community": 0.6,   // Support risk
  "single-maintainer": 0.9, // Bus factor risk
  "no-commercial-support": 0.4, // Enterprise risk
  "breaking-changes": 0.7,  // Stability risk
};
```

## Caching Strategy

### Research Cache
```json
{
  "cache": {
    "enabled": true,
    "ttl": {
      "best-practices": 604800,    // 1 week
      "library-comparison": 86400,  // 1 day
      "performance-data": 3600,     // 1 hour
      "security-advisories": 900    // 15 minutes
    },
    "storage": ".flow/research-cache/",
    "maxSize": "100MB"
  }
}
```
