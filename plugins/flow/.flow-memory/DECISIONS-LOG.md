## Active Decisions

### DEC-001: Database Selection
**Date**: 2024-01-10
**Status**: Implemented
**Category**: Technology
**Impact**: High

**Context**: Need persistent storage for user data, transactions, and audit logs.

**Decision**: PostgreSQL 14 with TypeORM

**Rationale**:
- Strong ACID compliance for financial data
- Excellent JSON support for flexible schemas
- Mature ecosystem and tooling
- Team has existing expertise
- Better performance for complex queries vs MySQL

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **MySQL 8**
   - Pros: Widespread adoption, good performance
   - Cons: Weaker JSON support, less flexible
   - Rejected: PostgreSQL better fits our needs

2. **MongoDB**
   - Pros: Flexible schema, horizontal scaling
   - Cons: Eventual consistency, less mature transactions
   - Rejected: Need strong consistency

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Robust data integrity, good performance
- Negative: Slightly higher operational complexity
- Technical Debt: None identified

**Implementation**:
- Affected: All data models, repositories
- Migration: N/A (greenfield)
- Effort: 2 days setup
- Assigned: Backend team

### DEC-002: Authentication Strategy
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Status**: Approved
**Category**: Architecture
**Impact**: High

**Context**: Need secure, scalable authentication for web and future mobile apps.

**Decision**: JWT with refresh token rotation

**Rationale**:
- Stateless authentication scales horizontally
- Works well with microservices architecture
- Standard for REST APIs
- Supports mobile clients efficiently
- Refresh tokens provide security with convenience

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Session-based Auth**
   - Pros: Simple, server-controlled
   - Cons: Requires sticky sessions, doesn't scale well
   - Rejected: Poor fit for distributed architecture

2. **OAuth2 Only**
   - Pros: Delegation, third-party integration
   - Cons: Complex for first-party auth
   - Rejected: Overkill for current needs

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Scalable, mobile-ready, industry standard
- Negative: Token management complexity
- Technical Debt: Need token revocation mechanism later

### DEC-003: API Design Standard
**Date**: 2024-01-12
**Status**: Implemented
**Category**: Architecture
**Impact**: Medium

**Context**: Need consistent API design across all services.

**Decision**: REST with OpenAPI 3.0 specification

**Rationale**:
- REST is well-understood by team
- OpenAPI enables auto-generation of docs/clients
- Good tooling ecosystem
- Standards-based approach

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **GraphQL**
   - Pros: Flexible queries, strong typing
   - Cons: Learning curve, complexity
   - Rejected: Team lacks experience

2. **gRPC**
   - Pros: Performance, streaming
   - Cons: Browser support issues
   - Rejected: Need web-first approach

## Deprecated Decisions

### DEC-000: Monolithic Architecture (DEPRECATED)
**Date**: 2024-01-01
**Deprecated**: 2024-01-08
**Replaced By**: DEC-004

**Original Decision**: Single monolithic application

**Deprecation Reason**:
- Scaling limitations identified
- Team structure better suited to services
- Deployment bottlenecks

**Migration Path**:
- Gradual extraction of services
- Database-per-service pattern
- API gateway for routing

## Principles & Guidelines

### Decision Principles
1. **Reversibility**: Prefer reversible decisions
2. **Simplicity**: Choose simple over clever
3. **Standards**: Use industry standards when possible
4. **Team Skills**: Consider team expertise
5. **Future Proof**: Think 2 years ahead, not 10

### Decision Process
1. Identify problem/opportunity
2. Research alternatives (min 2)
3. Prototype if high-risk
4. Document in this log
5. Get approval if high-impact
6. Implement with tracking
7. Review after 30 days

### Approval Requirements
- **Low Impact**: Developer discretion
- **Medium Impact**: Tech lead approval
- **High Impact**: Team consensus
- **Critical**: Stakeholder sign-off
