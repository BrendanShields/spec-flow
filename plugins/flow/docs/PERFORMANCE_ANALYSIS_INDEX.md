## Scalability Thresholds

| Scale | Status | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 1-20 features | ✅ Perfect | Standard workflow |
| 20-100 features | ✅ Good | Acceptable performance |
| 100-500 features | ⚠️ Caution | Plan optimization fixes |
| 500-1000 features | ❌ Problematic | Requires medium-term fixes |
| 1000+ features | ❌ Not viable | Requires architecture changes |

**Breaking Points**:
- 100 features: Directory lag (50-100ms)
- 200 features: Orchestration > 10 minutes
- 500 features: Memory/timeout risk begins
- 1000 features: System failure
