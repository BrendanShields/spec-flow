## Example 1: UX Checklist for E-commerce Checkout

**Context**: Validating checkout flow requirements

**Spec Section** (spec.md):
```markdown
## User Stories

### US-001: Complete Purchase
As a customer, I want to complete checkout quickly so I can finish my purchase.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC1: Checkout process is fast
- AC2: Payment form is user-friendly
- AC3: Confirmation shown after purchase
```

**Generated Checklist** (checklists/ux.md):
```markdown

## Clarity

- [~] CHK005 - Is "fast" quantified with timing thresholds (<3s per step)? [Clarity, AC1]
- [~] CHK006 - Is "user-friendly" defined with usability criteria? [Clarity, AC2]
- [ ] CHK007 - Are button labels explicitly specified ("Complete Order" vs "Submit")? [Clarity]

## Accessibility

- [?] CHK008 - Are WCAG 2.1 AA requirements specified? [Gap]
- [?] CHK009 - Is keyboard navigation flow defined? [Gap]

## Example 2: API Checklist for REST Endpoints

**Context**: Validating REST API specification

**Spec Section** (spec.md):
```markdown
## API Endpoints

### POST /api/orders
Create new order

**Request**: Order object
**Response**: Created order

**Errors**: Returns error if invalid
```

**Generated Checklist** (checklists/api.md):
```markdown
# API Quality Checklist

## Completeness

- [~] CHK001 - Is request schema fully defined with all fields, types, constraints? [Completeness, POST /api/orders]
- [~] CHK002 - Is response schema specified with all fields and status codes? [Completeness]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are all error scenarios enumerated (400, 401, 403, 422, 500)? [Completeness]
- [?] CHK004 - Is authentication mechanism specified (Bearer token, API key)? [Gap]
- [?] CHK005 - Are rate limiting rules defined? [Gap]

## Clarity

- [~] CHK006 - Is "order object" fully defined or referenced? [Clarity]
- [~] CHK007 - Is "error if invalid" specified with error response format? [Clarity]

## Consistency

- [?] CHK008 - Are error response formats consistent across all endpoints? [Gap]
- [?] CHK009 - Are field naming conventions specified (camelCase, snake_case)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK010 - Are timestamp formats consistent (ISO 8601)? [Consistency]

## REST Standards

- [?] CHK013 - Is pagination defined for collection endpoints? [Gap]

**Status**: 1/13 complete, 7 gaps, 5 need refinement
```

**Insight**: API spec lacks critical details. Add schemas, error formats, auth before planning.

## Example 5: Multi-Domain Checklist Generation

**Context**: Feature requires UX, API, and security validation

**Command**:
```bash
spec:checklist
```

**Generated Structure**:
```
features/042-user-profile/
├── spec.md
└── checklists/
    ├── README.md
    ├── ux.md              # 12 items
    ├── api.md             # 15 items
    └── security.md        # 18 items
```

**Summary** (checklists/README.md):
```markdown
# Quality Checklists for Feature 042: User Profile

Generated: 2024-01-15

## Checklists

- **ux.md**: 12 items (3 complete, 6 gaps, 3 refinements needed)
- **api.md**: 15 items (5 complete, 8 gaps, 2 refinements needed)
- **security.md**: 18 items (2 complete, 14 gaps, 2 refinements needed)

## Overall Status

**Total**: 45 items
**Complete**: 10 (22%)
**Gaps**: 28 (62%)
**Needs Refinement**: 7 (16%)

## Next Steps

1. Address all [?] gaps by adding missing requirements to spec.md
2. Refine [~] items with specific, measurable criteria
3. Validate [X] all items before proceeding to spec:plan
4. Re-run spec:checklist after spec updates to verify

## Workflow

```bash
# After addressing gaps
spec:checklist              # Regenerate to verify
spec:validate               # Check consistency
spec:plan                   # Proceed to technical design
```
```

**Insight**: 62% gaps indicates spec needs significant refinement before planning.

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Vague Requirements → Clarity Items

**Before**:
```markdown
- AC1: System is fast
```

**Checklist Item**:
```markdown
- [~] CHK001 - Is "fast" quantified with timing thresholds? [Clarity, AC1]
```

**After Refinement**:
```markdown
- AC1: System responds within 500ms for p95, 1s for p99
```

### Pattern 2: Missing Details → Gap Items

**Before**:
```markdown
- AC2: Users can authenticate
```

**Checklist Items**:
```markdown
- [?] CHK002 - Is authentication mechanism specified? [Gap, AC2]
- [?] CHK003 - Are password requirements defined? [Gap]
- [?] CHK004 - Is MFA requirement specified? [Gap]
- [?] CHK005 - Is session management defined? [Gap]
```

### Pattern 3: Consistency Validation

**Multiple Requirements**:
```markdown
- API-1: Returns JSON response
- API-2: Returns data object
```

**Checklist Item**:
```markdown
- [ ] CHK006 - Are response formats consistent across all endpoints? [Consistency, API-1, API-2]
```

## Usage Tips

1. **Run early**: After spec:specify, before spec:plan
2. **Address gaps first**: [?] items indicate missing requirements
3. **Quantify vague terms**: Replace "fast", "user-friendly", "secure" with metrics
4. **Iterate**: Re-run after spec updates to track progress
5. **Team validation**: Use checklists for peer review and approval gates
