# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
**Organisation**: Epic → Story → Sub Task hierarchy (no overlaps between epics)
**Sub Task Naming**: `ST-[Epic#].[Story#].[Sequence]`

---

## Tracking Guidelines

- **GitHub Issues**: Every story must have a matching GitHub issue with the sub-task checklist below.
- **External Tracker (e.g., JIRA)**: When configured, mirror the story as a JIRA issue and cross-link IDs. If no external tracker exists, document `External Tracker: None` within the GitHub issue.
- **Documentation Updates**: On completion of a story, update project-level docs (`.spec-memory/WORKFLOW-PROGRESS.md`, blueprints, PRD) before closing the issue.
