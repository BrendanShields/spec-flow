⏺ Orbit Workflow Analysis Summary

  🚀🌑 Orbit Status
  - Phase: initialize
  - Feature: none
  - Next Step: create-feature

  Based on my exploration, here's what I've discovered about the Orbit
  workflow system:

  Overview

  The Orbit workflow is a comprehensive specification-driven development
  system that replaces the older /spec command. It's designed to guide users
   through the entire development lifecycle with two main entry points:

  1. Core Architecture

  Main Commands:
  - /orbit - Primary workflow entry with context-aware guidance
  - /spec-track - Metrics, maintenance, and progress monitoring

  Skills Family:
  - orbit-lifecycle - Handles initialization, specification, clarification,
  implementation, and tracking
  - orbit-planning - Manages architecture, technical planning, task
  breakdown, and consistency validation
  - orbit-orchestrator - Auto-mode wrapper that chains lifecycle and
  planning phases automatically
  - analyzing-codebase - Brownfield project analysis

  2. Current State

  The project is initialized with:
  - .spec/ directory created
  - Configuration at .spec/.spec-config.yml (v3.3.0)
  - State tracking in .spec/state/
  - Memory persistence in .spec/memory/
  - No active feature or auto-mode session
  - Phase: "initialize" waiting to create first feature

  3. Workflow Phases

  The Orbit system guides through these phases:
  1. Initialize → Setup project structure
  2. Generate → Create specifications with user stories
  3. Clarify → Resolve ambiguities ([CLARIFY] tags)
  4. Plan → Technical design, architecture, ADRs
  5. Tasks → Break into actionable items with priorities
  6. Implement → Execute tasks (may delegate to spec-implementer agent)

  4. Key Innovation: Auto-Mode

  Auto-mode is a powerful feature that:
  - Runs the entire workflow autonomously (5-7 minutes vs 15+ minutes
  interactive)
  - Uses checkpoints for user review at phase transitions
  - Maintains session state for 24-hour resume capability
  - Automatically handles interruptions and can resume where it left off

  5. Hook Integration

  The system uses sophisticated event-driven automation:
  - SessionStart: Initializes state, restores sessions, prefetches next
  steps
  - UserPromptSubmit: Appends workflow context to prompts
  - PostToolUse: Updates workflow state after skill execution
  - Notification: Surfaces next recommended actions
  - SubagentStop/Stop: Aggregates results and creates session summaries

  6. Interactive UI Design

  The /orbit command uses AskUserQuestion for intuitive interaction:
  - Context-aware options based on current state
  - No need to remember skill names
  - Multi-tab questions when multiple actions are relevant
  - Clear descriptions for each option

  7. Plugin Marketplace Structure

  This is part of the spec-marketplace:
  - Single plugin ("spec") with version 2.1.0
  - Categories: development, testing, deployment, utilities
  - MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations planned for JIRA, Confluence,
  GitHub
  - Modular structure allows adding more plugins to the marketplace

  Next Steps

  Based on the current state (initialized, no feature), the system is ready
  to:
  1. Start Auto-Mode - Fast, autonomous feature development
  2. Interactive Mode - Step-by-step controlled workflow
  3. Analyze Codebase - For brownfield projects
  4. Create Architecture - Define system blueprints

  The Orbit workflow represents a significant evolution from traditional
  command-based approaches, offering both autonomous and interactive modes
  with sophisticated state management and resume capabilities.

⏺ 🚀🌑 Orbit Status
  - Phase: initialize
  - Feature: none
  - Next Step: create-feature

  Your project is initialized and ready to begin! The Orbit workflow system
  is set up to guide you through specification-driven development.
                                                
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · What would you like to do? → 🚀 Auto Mode

⏺ Great choice! Auto Mode will guide you through the entire workflow
  autonomously with checkpoints for your review. Let me invoke the
  orbit-orchestrator skill to begin.

> The "orbit-orchestrator" skill is running 

⏺ I'll help you set up auto-mode for the Orbit workflow. The orchestrator
  skill will guide you through creating a new feature with minimal
  interaction.

⏺ 🚀 Auto-Mode Workflow Starting

  I'll orchestrate the complete specification-driven development workflow
  with strategic checkpoints. This typically takes 5-7 minutes total.

  Phase Overview:

  1. Specification - Define what to build
  2. Clarification - Resolve ambiguities (if any)
  3. Planning - Design the solution
  4. Tasks - Break down into actionable items
  5. Implementation - Build (optional, with your approval)

  Let me start by gathering your feature requirements.
                                                                           
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · What feature would you like to build? Please describe it in detail, 
     including key requirements, priorities (P1/P2/P3), and any specific 
     constraints or preferences. → Subagents to improve this workflow.

⏺ Excellent! I'll help you build subagents to enhance the Orbit workflow.
  This is a meta-improvement that will make the workflow itself more
  capable.

  Let me initialize the auto-mode session and begin the specification phase.

⏺ Write(.spec/state/auto-mode-session.json)
  ⎿  Wrote 23 lines to .spec/state/auto-mode-session.json
     {
       "session_id": "orbit-auto-001",
       "mode": "auto",
       "status": "running",

         "after_spec": true,
         "after_clarify": true,
     … +13 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Now I'll invoke the orbit-lifecycle skill to create the specification for
  workflow subagents:

> The "orbit-lifecycle" skill is running 
  ⎿  Allowed 6 tools for this command

⏺ I'll now create the specification for workflow subagents to improve the
  Orbit system. Let me set up the feature directory and generate the
  specification.

⏺ Bash(mkdir -p .spec/features/001-workflow-subagents)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Write(.spec/features/001-workflow-subagents/spec.md)

⏺ ---
  ✅ CHECKPOINT: Specification Complete

  Created:
  - 📄 .spec/features/001-workflow-subagents/spec.md (6 user stories)
  - 📋 4 clarification points identified

  Summary:
  The specification defines specialized subagents to enhance the Orbit
  workflow:
  - Core Subagents: spec-implementer, spec-researcher, consistency-analyzer,
   specification-analyzer, codebase-analyzer
  - Key Benefits: Parallel execution, autonomous operation, better error
  recovery
  - Success Metrics: 30-50% workflow time reduction, 60% fewer manual
  interventions

  Clarifications Needed:
  1. Should validation be blocking or advisory?
  2. How often should consistency checks run?
  3. Which sources should be prioritized for research?
  4. Should subagents support MCP protocol?

  Next Phase: Clarifications (Phase 2/5)

  ---
  I'll now resolve these clarification points to ensure the specification is
   complete and unambiguous:
                                                                           
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Should specification validation be blocking (stops workflow) or 
     advisory (warns but continues)? → Advisory
     · How often should consistency checks run between artifacts? → Critical
      Points
     · Which sources should be prioritized for technical research? → 
     Official Docs
     · Should subagents support MCP (Model Context Protocol) for external 
     tools? → Yes, Optional

  ✅ CHECKPOINT: Planning Complete

  🎯 All Planning Phases Completed Successfully!

  Created Artifacts:

  - 📄 Specification: 6 user stories, 4 clarifications resolved
  - 🏗️ Technical Plan: 10-section architecture with components, APIs, data
  models
  - 📋 Task Breakdown: 40 tasks across 5 implementation phases

  Summary:

  Feature: Workflow Subagents - Specialized autonomous agents for Orbit
  workflow
  Estimated Effort: 220 hours total (110 hours with 3 developers in
  parallel)
  Critical Path: 65 hours through core framework and integration
  Expected Outcomes:
  - 40-50% workflow time reduction
  - 60% fewer manual interventions
  - 3x parallel execution capability

  Key Architecture Decisions:

  1. Advisory validation - Warnings don't block workflow
  2. Critical point checks - Consistency validation before
  planning/implementation
  3. JSON state persistence - Simple, reliable, human-readable
  4. Optional MCP support - Graceful fallback for compatibility

  Implementation Ready:

  The first task (T001) creates the .claude/agents/ directory structure.
  Implementation would proceed through:
  - Foundation framework (Week 1)
  - Core agents (Week 2)
  - Orchestration system (Week 3)
  - Integration & testing (Week 4-5)

  Next Phase: Implementation (Phase 5/5)
