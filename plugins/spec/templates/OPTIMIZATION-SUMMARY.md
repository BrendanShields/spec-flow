## Overall Results

**Total Lines Before**: 1,943 lines
**Total Lines After**: 668 lines
**Reduction**: 1,275 lines (66% overall reduction)
**Target Met**: YES (exceeded 50% target)

## Optimization Strategy

### 1. Metadata & Standards References
- **Replaced** extensive inline guidance with references to `_shared/user-story-format.md`
- **Replaced** metadata frontmatter examples with references to `_shared/metadata-frontmatter.md`
- **Benefit**: Eliminates duplication, centralizes standards

### 2. Removed Excessive Inline Comments
- Removed all `<!--` comment blocks explaining template usage
- Removed "ACTION REQUIRED" notices and advisory sections
- **Benefit**: Cleaner, more focused templates

### 3. Consolidated Placeholder Examples
- Reduced placeholder examples by 50-70%
- Consolidated redundant patterns into single concise examples
- Used tables instead of repetitive section structures
- **Benefit**: Faster template navigation

### 4. Streamlined Structure
- Merged related sections where appropriate
- Used horizontal tabs (|) for metadata instead of separate lines
- Consolidated multi-line headings into single-line summaries
- **Benefit**: Reduced visual clutter

### 5. Removed Redundant Sections
- Eliminated duplicate content between fields
- Removed extensive "what should be documented" sections
- Consolidated "guidelines" into single-line statements
- **Benefit**: Faster onboarding

## How to Use Optimized Templates

### Quick Start Workflow

1. **Create Feature**: Copy appropriate template from `templates/`
2. **Reference Standards**: Templates reference `_shared/` files for:
   - User story format: `_shared/user-story-format.md`
   - Metadata frontmatter: `_shared/metadata-frontmatter.md`
3. **Fill in Sections**: Replace `[PLACEHOLDERS]` with actual content
4. **Review Blueprint**: Check architecture-blueprint-template.md for alignment

### Template Selection

| Template | Purpose | Use When |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **spec-template.md** | Feature requirements | Starting new feature work |
| **plan-template.md** | Technical design | Planning implementation |
| **tasks-template.md** | Implementation tasks | Breaking down work |
| **product-requirements-template.md** | Project-level requirements | Defining product vision |
| **architecture-blueprint-template.md** | Architecture standards | Setting project patterns |
| **confluence-page.md** | Public documentation | Syncing to Confluence |

---

## Key Features Preserved

All critical guidance elements were preserved:

- User story prioritization (P1/P2/P3)
- Acceptance criteria format (Given/When/Then)
- Task phasing (Setup → Foundational → Features)
- Parallel execution markers [P]
- Independent testability principle
- Blueprint alignment checks
- JIRA integration support
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)

---

## Migration Path for Existing Documents

Existing feature documents don't need changes:
- All templates remain functionally equivalent
- Only formatting/organization differs
- Features can reference both old and new templates

---

## Maintenance Going Forward

### When to Update Templates

1. **Architecture changes**: Update architecture-blueprint-template.md
2. **User story format changes**: Update _shared/user-story-format.md
3. **New phase structure**: Update tasks-template.md
4. **New requirement categories**: Update product-requirements-template.md

### Template Versioning

Each template includes `[DATE]` placeholder for tracking updates. Consider adding version number for major changes.
