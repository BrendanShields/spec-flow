# Spec Plugin Product Requirements

## Executive Summary

Spec is a specification-driven development workflow plugin for Claude Code that transforms how developers build software by enforcing a disciplined approach: think first, specify clearly, then implement systematically.

## Vision

**Mission**: Eliminate the chaos of ad-hoc development by providing a structured, AI-assisted workflow that ensures every line of code has purpose and every feature delivers value.

**Target Users**:
- Individual developers seeking structured workflows
- Small teams wanting consistent development practices
- Claude Code users building complex applications
- Engineers who value planning over debugging

## Core Features

### P1: Essential Workflow (Must Have)

#### 1. Specification Management
- Create detailed feature specifications with user stories
- Prioritize requirements (P1/P2/P3)
- Track acceptance criteria
- Support iterative refinement

#### 2. Technical Planning
- Generate architecture decisions from specifications
- Create component designs
- Document API contracts
- Identify technical risks

#### 3. Task Execution
- Break plans into atomic, actionable tasks
- Support parallel task execution
- Track progress across sessions
- Validate implementation against specs

#### 4. State Persistence
- Maintain workflow state between Claude sessions
- Track completed/pending tasks
- Save session checkpoints
- Support work resumption

### P2: Productivity Features (Should Have)

#### 5. Intelligent Assistance
- Context-aware help system
- Workflow validation
- Consistency checking
- Progress metrics

#### 6. Integration Capabilities
- Git workflow integration
- JIRA synchronization (when available)
- Confluence documentation (when available)
- MCP server support

#### 7. Customization
- Custom templates
- Workflow hooks
- Team-specific configurations
- Project type adaptations

### P3: Advanced Features (Nice to Have)

#### 8. Analytics & Reporting
- Development velocity metrics
- AI vs human code ratios
- Feature completion tracking
- Quality metrics

#### 9. Team Collaboration
- Shared memory files
- Team decision logs
- Handoff documentation
- Review workflows

## Success Metrics

### Adoption
- **Target**: 1000+ active users within 6 months
- **Measure**: Plugin installations, daily active usage

### Productivity
- **Target**: 40% reduction in development time
- **Measure**: Feature completion velocity

### Quality
- **Target**: 60% fewer post-implementation changes
- **Measure**: Specification stability, rework tracking

### User Satisfaction
- **Target**: 4.5+ star rating
- **Measure**: User feedback, GitHub stars

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Command response time < 2 seconds
- State file operations < 500ms
- Memory usage < 50MB
- Context window optimization

### Compatibility
- Claude Code v2.0+
- Git 2.0+
- Node.js 18+ (for MCP)
- Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)

### Reliability
- Graceful error handling
- State recovery mechanisms
- Validation at every step
- Comprehensive logging

## Constraints

### Technical
- Claude's context window limits
- File system permissions
- Git repository requirements
- No external dependencies (pure bash/markdown)

### User Experience
- Minimal learning curve
- Progressive disclosure
- Clear error messages
- Intuitive command structure

## Release Strategy

### v2.1.0 (Current)
- ✅ Core workflow complete
- ✅ 14 skills implemented
- ✅ State management stable
- ✅ Documentation comprehensive

### v2.2.0 (Next)
- [ ] Enhanced integrations
- [ ] Custom templates UI
- [ ] Advanced metrics
- [ ] Team features

### v3.0.0 (Future)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Context window exhaustion
- **Mitigation**: Template optimization, progressive loading

### User Adoption Risks
- **Risk**: Learning curve too steep
- **Mitigation**: Quick start guide, interactive help

### Maintenance Risks
- **Risk**: Plugin compatibility breaks
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, version detection

## Stakeholders

- **Plugin Developer** (You): Maintenance and enhancement
- **Claude Code Team**: Platform integration
- **End Users**: Developers using Spec
- **Contributors**: Open source community

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional**: All P1 features working reliably
2. **Usable**: New users productive within 30 minutes
3. **Maintainable**: Clear code, comprehensive tests
4. **Scalable**: Handles large projects efficiently
5. **Valuable**: Measurable productivity improvement
