## Feature 001: Comprehensive Refactoring

**Started**: 2025-11-03
**Status**: Planning complete, implementation pending

### Completed Planning Artifacts

**2025-11-03 - Specification Phase**
- ✅ Created `.spec/features/001-comprehensive-refactoring/spec.md`
  - 6 epics defined (Documentation, State, Token, Command, Refactor, Auto-Mode)
  - 18 user stories with acceptance criteria
  - Edge cases documented
  - Success criteria defined

**2025-11-03 - Planning Phase**
- ✅ Created `.spec/features/001-comprehensive-refactoring/plan.md`
  - 9-phase implementation strategy
  - 100-hour timeline (3 weeks)
  - 4 ADRs documented
  - Risk assessment complete
  - Rollback plan defined

**2025-11-03 - Task Breakdown Phase**
- ✅ Created `.spec/features/001-comprehensive-refactoring/tasks.md`
  - 9 epics organized by priority
  - 60+ subtasks with time estimates
  - Dependencies mapped
  - Critical path identified (32h P0 tasks)

**2025-11-03 - State Management**
- ✅ Created `.spec/state/current-session.md` (tracking active feature)
- ✅ Created `.spec/state/memory/WORKFLOW-PROGRESS.md` (feature list)
- ✅ Created `.spec/state/memory/DECISIONS-LOG.md` (4 ADRs)
- ✅ Created `.spec/state/memory/CHANGES-PLANNED.md` (60+ planned tasks)
- ✅ Created `.spec/state/memory/CHANGES-COMPLETED.md` (this file)

**2025-11-03 - Checkpoint Protocol Added**
- ✅ Updated `plan.md` with comprehensive AskUserQuestion checkpoints
  - Added checkpoint protocol section (lines 97-110)
  - Added checkpoint before each phase (9 checkpoints)
  - Added checkpoints after each major step (30+ checkpoints)
  - Added checkpoints after test scenarios (5 checkpoints)
  - Added final production ready checkpoint
  - **Total: 40+ checkpoints throughout implementation**

### Meta-Achievement

**Workflow System Validation**: This session successfully demonstrated the complete Spec workflow:

1. ✅ Command invocation: /workflow:spec
2. ✅ Auto Mode selection
3. ✅ Requirements gathering
4. ✅ Specification generation (spec.md)
5. ✅ Technical planning (plan.md)
6. ✅ Task breakdown (tasks.md)
7. ✅ State management (all files created)
8. ✅ **Checkpoint protocol enforced** (AskUserQuestion at every decision)

**Lesson**: Following the workflow produces comprehensive, actionable artifacts. Adding explicit checkpoints ensures human oversight. This is proof the system works when used correctly!
