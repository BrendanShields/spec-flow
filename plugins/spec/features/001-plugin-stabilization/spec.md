# Feature Specification: Plugin Stabilization

**Feature ID**: 001-plugin-stabilization
**Priority**: P1 (Critical)
**Created**: 2024-10-30
**Status**: Active

## Executive Summary

Complete the Navi→Spec refactor by documenting, validating, and committing all changes to establish a stable v2.1.0 release of the Spec plugin for the Claude Code marketplace.

## Background & Context

### Current Situation
- Refactor from Navi to Spec is functionally complete
- ~200+ files have been added, modified, or deleted
- All components renamed and optimized (66% token reduction achieved)
- Changes are uncommitted and need proper documentation

### Problem Statement
The plugin refactor is complete but exists only in the working directory. Without proper documentation and commits, the work could be lost and cannot be shared with users.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All changes documented and understood
- [ ] Git repository clean with organized commits
- [ ] Plugin installable and functional
- [ ] Marketplace listing updated
- [ ] Documentation accurate and complete

## Epics & User Stories

### Epic 1: Documentation & Traceability (PRD §2.1 / Blueprint DOC-01)

**Goal**: Preserve institutional knowledge for the Spec plugin refactor.
**Success Metrics**: Complete audit trail, up-to-date docs, approval from maintainers.

#### Story 1.1 – Document Changes (P1)
**As a** plugin maintainer
**I want to** document all uncommitted changes
**So that** I understand what was modified and why

**GitHub Issue**: #TBD-001 (sub task checklist required)
**External Tracker**: None

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Scenario**: Catalogue deletions
  - **Given** the working tree contains removed Navi assets
  - **When** I export file status reports
  - **Then** I can explain why each deletion occurred in the change log
- **Scenario**: Catalogue additions
  - **Given** new Spec components exist locally
  - **When** I enumerate new files with their purposes
  - **Then** the product requirements document reflects each addition
- **Scenario**: Migration path
  - **Given** users are migrating from Navi
  - **When** I outline the before/after structure
  - **Then** maintainers can follow the documented migration path without ambiguity

#### Story 1.2 – Update Documentation (P2)
**As a** plugin user
**I want to** have accurate documentation
**So that** I can use Spec effectively

**GitHub Issue**: #TBD-002
**External Tracker**: None

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Scenario**: README alignment
  - **Given** the README references Navi assets
  - **When** I replace outdated sections with Spec guidance
  - **Then** all instructions match the refactored plugin
- **Scenario**: Command examples
  - **Given** example commands exist in docs
  - **When** I execute each command in a staging environment
  - **Then** the documented output matches actual behaviour

### Epic 2: Release Hygiene & Validation (PRD §2.2 / Blueprint REL-02)

**Goal**: Deliver a clean, working release with traceable commits.
**Success Metrics**: Passing regression tests, sequenced commits, install validation.

#### Story 2.1 – Organise Commits (P1)
**As a** plugin maintainer
**I want to** organise changes into logical commits
**So that** the git history is clean and understandable

**GitHub Issue**: #TBD-003
**External Tracker**: None

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Scenario**: Functional grouping
  - **Given** hundreds of file changes
  - **When** I stage updates by functional area
  - **Then** each commit contains a coherent unit of work
- **Scenario**: Commit hygiene
  - **Given** commit templates are defined
  - **When** I craft messages for each commit
  - **Then** the history explains the Navi→Spec migration without ambiguity

#### Story 2.2 – Validate Functionality (P1)
**As a** plugin maintainer
**I want to** test the plugin thoroughly
**So that** users receive a working product

**GitHub Issue**: #TBD-004
**External Tracker**: None

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Scenario**: Installation smoke test
  - **Given** a clean Claude Code workspace
  - **When** I install the packaged plugin
  - **Then** the installation succeeds without errors
- **Scenario**: Command execution
  - **Given** each core command is available
  - **When** I execute `/spec init`, `/spec plan`, and `/spec tasks`
  - **Then** the commands run without runtime failures
- **Scenario**: Regression guard
  - **Given** automated validation scripts exist
  - **When** I run the regression suite
  - **Then** no prior functionality is broken

#### Story 2.3 – Clean Configuration (P2)
**As a** plugin maintainer
**I want to** resolve configuration conflicts
**So that** the plugin structure is consistent

**GitHub Issue**: #TBD-005
**External Tracker**: None

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Scenario**: .gitignore alignment
  - **Given** conflicting ignore rules are present
  - **When** I reconcile them against the new structure
  - **Then** only intentional files remain tracked
- **Scenario**: Validation of configuration
  - **Given** updated config files
  - **When** I run linting and schema checks
  - **Then** no configuration errors remain

### Epic 3: Migration Support (PRD §2.3 / Blueprint MIG-03)

**Goal**: Provide a safe migration path for existing Navi users.
**Success Metrics**: Published migration guide, user feedback readiness.

#### Story 3.1 – Publish Migration Guide (P3)
**As a** existing user
**I want to** understand how to migrate from Navi
**So that** I can update smoothly

**GitHub Issue**: #TBD-006
**External Tracker**: None

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Scenario**: Migration steps
  - **Given** the documented refactor
  - **When** I outline step-by-step upgrade instructions
  - **Then** users can perform the migration without extra support
- **Scenario**: Breaking changes log
  - **Given** differences between Navi and Spec
  - **When** I document breaking changes and mitigation strategies
  - **Then** users know how to handle incompatibilities

## Technical Requirements

### File Organization
- Group related changes together
- Maintain atomic commits
- Preserve refactor traceability

### Git Strategy
```bash
# Suggested commit structure:
1. Remove old Flow/Navi artifacts
2. Add Spec core structure
3. Add skills and commands
4. Add state and memory systems
5. Update documentation
6. Fix configuration
```

### Testing Requirements
- Local installation test
- Command execution tests
- Skill trigger tests
- State persistence tests

## Implementation Notes

### Change Summary
**Deleted** (~150 files):
- Old `__specification__/` directory
- Previous `.flow/` configurations
- Legacy Navi skills and commands
- Backup directories

**Added** (~50 files):
- New `.spec/` structure
- Spec skills (14 total)
- Spec commands (8 total)
- State and memory templates
- Updated documentation

**Modified** (~10 files):
- marketplace.json
- .gitignore
- Root documentation files

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Lost work | High | Create backup before commits |
| Broken plugin | High | Test thoroughly before push |
| User confusion | Medium | Clear migration guide |
| Missing files | Medium | Validate structure completely |

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Git repository access
- Claude Code for testing
- Marketplace account for publishing

### Knowledge Dependencies
- Understanding of all changes made
- Knowledge of git best practices

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All changes documented in detail
- [ ] Commits organized and executed
- [ ] Plugin tested and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Configuration conflicts resolved
- [ ] Ready for marketplace publication

## Time Estimate

**Total Estimate**: 4-6 hours

Breakdown:

- Commit organization: 1 hour
- Testing: 1-2 hours
- Configuration fixes: 30 minutes
- Final validation: 30 minutes
