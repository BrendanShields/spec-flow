# Feature Specification: Plugin Stabilization

**Feature ID**: 001-plugin-stabilization
**Priority**: P1 (Critical)
**Created**: 2024-10-30
**Status**: Active

## Executive Summary

Complete the Naviâ†’Spec refactor by documenting, validating, and committing all changes to establish a stable v2.1.0 release of the Spec plugin for the Claude Code marketplace.

## Background & Context

### Current Situation
- Refactor from Navi to Spec is functionally complete
- ~200+ files have been added, modified, or deleted
- All components renamed and optimized (66% token reduction achieved)
- Changes are uncommitted and need proper documentation

### Problem Statement
The plugin refactor is complete but exists only in the working directory. Without proper documentation and commits, the work could be lost and cannot be shared with users.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All changes documented and understood
- [ ] Git repository clean with organized commits
- [ ] Plugin installable and functional
- [ ] Marketplace listing updated
- [ ] Documentation accurate and complete

**As a** existing user
**I want to** understand how to migrate from Navi
**So that** I can update smoothly

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Migration steps documented
- [ ] Breaking changes listed
- [ ] Compatibility notes included

## Technical Requirements

### File Organization
- Group related changes together
- Maintain atomic commits
- Preserve refactor traceability

### Git Strategy
```bash
# Suggested commit structure:
1. Remove old Flow/Navi artifacts
2. Add Spec core structure
3. Add skills and commands
4. Add state and memory systems
5. Update documentation
6. Fix configuration
```

### Testing Requirements
- Local installation test
- Command execution tests
- Skill trigger tests
- State persistence tests

## Implementation Notes

### Change Summary
**Deleted** (~150 files):
- Old `__specification__/` directory
- Previous `.flow/` configurations
- Legacy Navi skills and commands
- Backup directories

**Added** (~50 files):
- New `.spec/` structure
- Spec skills (14 total)
- Spec commands (8 total)
- State and memory templates
- Updated documentation

**Modified** (~10 files):
- marketplace.json
- .gitignore
- Root documentation files

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Lost work | High | Create backup before commits |
| Broken plugin | High | Test thoroughly before push |
| User confusion | Medium | Clear migration guide |
| Missing files | Medium | Validate structure completely |

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Git repository access
- Claude Code for testing
- Marketplace account for publishing

### Knowledge Dependencies
