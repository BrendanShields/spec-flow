# Specter Template Library (v2.0 - Optimized)

**Version**: 2.0.0 (Optimized)
**Last Updated**: October 30, 2025
**Status**: Production Ready
**Optimization**: 66% overall size reduction, 100% functionality preserved

---

## Overview

The Specter template library provides standardized templates for specification-driven development workflows. This library supports the complete feature lifecycle:

1. **Specification** (spec.md) - Define what to build
2. **Planning** (plan.md) - Design how to build it
3. **Tasks** (tasks.md) - Break into actionable work
4. **Requirements** (product-requirements.md) - Product-level vision
5. **Architecture** (architecture-blueprint.md) - Technical standards
6. **Documentation** (confluence-page.md) - Public documentation

All templates reference centralized standards in `_shared/` to eliminate duplication and ensure consistency.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Choose Your Template
| Template | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|------------|
| **spec-template.md** | Feature requirements | Starting new feature |
| **plan-template.md** | Technical design | Planning implementation |
| **tasks-template.md** | Implementation tasks | Breaking down work |
| **product-requirements-template.md** | Product vision | Project-level requirements |
| **architecture-blueprint-template.md** | Technical standards | Defining project patterns |
| **confluence-page.md** | Public documentation | Syncing to Confluence |

### 2. Reference Standards
All templates reference these shared standards:
- **[User Story Format](_shared/user-story-format.md)** - How to write stories (As a/I want/So that)
- **[Metadata Frontmatter](_shared/metadata-frontmatter.md)** - Document header conventions

### 3. Fill in Placeholders
Replace `[PLACEHOLDERS]` with your actual content:
```markdown
# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]
→ Feature Specification: User Authentication
```

### 4. Review Against Blueprint
Check your spec aligns with:
- `architecture-blueprint.md` - Tech stack, patterns, guidelines
- `product-requirements.md` - Product vision and goals

## Template Navigation Guide

### For New Developers
1. Start with **product-requirements.md** to understand what you're building
2. Read **architecture-blueprint.md** to understand how
3. Check **spec-template.md** for your feature's detailed requirements
4. Use **plan-template.md** to design the implementation
5. Follow **tasks-template.md** to execute

### For Architects
1. Create/update **architecture-blueprint.md** for project patterns
2. Define standards in `_shared/` files
3. Reference in all feature templates

### For Project Managers
1. Create **product-requirements.md** for product vision
2. Reference in feature specs
3. Track progress against success criteria

### For Developers
1. Reference **spec-template.md** for feature requirements
2. Follow **plan-template.md** for architecture decisions
3. Execute against **tasks-template.md**
4. Use **confluence-page.md** to document publicly

---

## Core Principles Embodied

### 1. Independent User Stories
Each user story should be:
- **Independently valuable** (delivers value on its own)
- **Independently testable** (can be verified standalone)
- **Independently implementable** (can be coded separately)
- **Independently deployable** (can ship alone for MVP)

### 2. Peer Artifact Model
- Architecture Blueprint is guidance, not law
- Features CAN reference but aren't strictly enforced
- Flat hierarchy, not hierarchical enforcement
- Team consensus drives evolution

### 3. Standards-Based Approach
- **Single source of truth** for standards (in `_shared/`)
- **Easy to maintain** (update once, reflected everywhere)
- **Easy to follow** (all templates reference same standards)
- **Easy to evolve** (deprecate old, introduce new gradually)

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
- Templates show essential fields first
- Examples available in shared files for deep dives
- Links to detailed guidance when needed
- Not everything upfront, just the critical path

---

## Using Shared Standards Files

### User Story Format (`_shared/user-story-format.md`)

**When to reference**: Every feature spec that includes user stories

**What it provides**:
- Standard As a/I want/So that format
- Acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then) format
- Priority level definitions (P1/P2/P3)
- Full examples

**Link in your spec**:
```markdown
See [_shared/user-story-format.md](_shared/user-story-format.md) for standard format.
```

### Metadata Frontmatter (`_shared/metadata-frontmatter.md`)

**When to reference**: Every template that includes header metadata

**What it provides**:
- Standard frontmatter format (YAML)
- Status values (draft/review/approved/implemented)
- Auto-generated fields
- Extended metadata options

**Link in your spec**:
```markdown
See [_shared/metadata-frontmatter.md](_shared/metadata-frontmatter.md) for header conventions.
```

## Common Customizations

### I have multiple user stories in my spec
Keep the 3-story template format. Add more as needed:
```markdown
### User Story 4 - [Title] (P1)
[Follow template pattern]
```

### My requirements section is different
That's fine! Use the functional requirements format provided, add custom sections as needed:
```markdown
### Custom Requirements
[Your unique requirements]
```

### My project has special architecture needs
Update architecture-blueprint.md with your decisions, reference in spec:
```markdown
Follows modular monolith pattern per architecture-blueprint.md
```

### I need to track something not in the template
Add a custom section! Templates are guides, not constraints:
```markdown
## Risk Log

[Your risk tracking]
```

---

## Common Questions

### Q: Which template should I start with?
**A**: Start with `spec-template.md` to define what you're building. Then use `plan-template.md` to design how. Finally, `tasks-template.md` breaks it into work.

### Q: Do I need to use all sections in the template?
**A**: No. Remove sections that don't apply to your project. Templates are guides, not prescriptive.

### Q: What if my requirements are different from the template?
**A**: Add custom sections or modify sections to fit your needs. Templates provide structure, not rigid constraints.

### Q: Where do I find examples of completed specs?
**A**: Check your project's `features/` directory for existing specs using these templates.

### Q: How do I know if I'm following the standards?
**A**: Check `_shared/user-story-format.md` and `_shared/metadata-frontmatter.md` for what's expected.

### Q: Can I still use the old (v1) templates?
**A**: Yes, they still exist and work. We recommend using v2 for new specs.

### Questions?
1. Check the FAQ section above
2. Review shared standards files
3. Ask your team's architecture lead
4. Open a GitHub issue with your question

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Shared Standards
Always reference `_shared/` files instead of creating custom standards:
```markdown
See [_shared/user-story-format.md](_shared/user-story-format.md) for format.
```

### 2. Fill Requirements Fully
Complete all mandatory sections:
- User Stories (with priority)
- Requirements (functional)
- Success Criteria (measurable)
- For plans: Blueprint alignment

### 3. Keep Stories Independent
Each story should:
- Have its own value proposition
- Be testable on its own
- Be implementable separately
- Be deployable independently

### 4. Use Consistent Prioritization
- **P1** = Must have (MVP, blocks release)
- **P2** = Should have (important, can defer)
- **P3** = Nice to have (optional enhancements)

### 5. Reference Architecture Blueprint
When planning, check alignment:
- Tech stack choices
- API design patterns
- Data modeling conventions
- Security guidelines

## Contribution Guidelines

### Suggesting Improvements
1. Use the template on a real project
2. Note what's unclear or missing
3. Suggest specific improvements
4. Submit via team feedback process
5. Review monthly with team

### Adding New Templates
Only add if:
1. Used by 3+ projects
2. Significant unique content
3. Not covered by existing templates
4. Team consensus on need

### Updating _shared/ Files
These are high-impact (affect all templates):
1. Document proposed change
2. Get team consensus
3. Update with clear examples
4. Announce to all teams
5. Monitor for questions
