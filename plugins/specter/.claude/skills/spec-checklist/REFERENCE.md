## Quality Dimensions

### 1. Completeness

**Definition**: All necessary requirements for the domain are defined.

**Test Questions**:
- Are all required items present?
- Are all scenarios covered?
- Are edge cases addressed?
- Are dependencies specified?

**Examples**:
```markdown
GOOD: "Are error response schemas defined for all 4xx and 5xx status codes?"
GOOD: "Are loading states specified for all async operations?"
BAD: "Is the API documented?" (too broad)
```

### 2. Clarity

**Definition**: Requirements are specific, unambiguous, and measurable.

**Vague Terms to Quantify**:
- "Fast" → "<500ms p95 response time"
- "User-friendly" → "SUS score >80, task completion >90%"
- "Secure" → "TLS 1.3, AES-256, OWASP Top 10 mitigations"
- "Scalable" → "Support 10k concurrent users, 100k RPS"
- "Reliable" → "99.9% uptime SLA, <1% error rate"

**Test Questions**:
- Can this be objectively measured?
- Are specific values provided?
- Is terminology defined?
- Are units included?

**Examples**:
```markdown
GOOD: "Is 'fast loading' quantified (<3s LCP, <100ms FID)?"
GOOD: "Is color contrast ratio specified (4.5:1 minimum)?"
BAD: "Is it clear?" (meta-question, not testable)
```

### 3. Consistency

**Definition**: Patterns, terminology, and formats are uniform across requirements.

**Test Questions**:
- Are naming conventions consistent?
- Are error formats aligned?
- Are units uniform?
- Are patterns repeated?

**Examples**:
```markdown
GOOD: "Are timestamp formats consistent (ISO 8601) across all APIs?"
GOOD: "Are button states (default, hover, active, disabled) defined consistently?"
BAD: "Is it consistent?" (not specific enough)
```

### 4. Measurability

**Definition**: Acceptance criteria can be objectively verified.

**Test Questions**:
- Can success be measured?
- Are acceptance criteria testable?
- Are metrics defined?
- Can it be automated?

**Examples**:
```markdown
GOOD: "Are accessibility criteria measurable (WCAG 2.1 AA conformance)?"
GOOD: "Are performance targets testable (Lighthouse score >90)?"
BAD: "Does it meet requirements?" (circular logic)
```

### 5. Coverage

**Definition**: All scenarios, edge cases, and failure modes are addressed.

**Test Questions**:
- Are success paths defined?
- Are error paths specified?
- Are edge cases covered?
- Are timeout scenarios addressed?

**Examples**:
```markdown
GOOD: "Are network failure scenarios specified (offline, slow 3G, timeout)?"
GOOD: "Are concurrent modification conflicts addressed?"
BAD: "Are all cases covered?" (not specific)
```

### 6. Gap

**Definition**: Required information is missing from specification.

**Test Questions**:
- What requirements should exist but don't?
- What industry standards apply?
- What dependencies are unspecified?
- What compliance requirements are missing?

**Examples**:
```markdown
GOOD: "Are rate limiting rules defined? [Gap]"
GOOD: "Is GDPR data retention period specified? [Gap]"
GOOD: "Are database indexes defined for query performance? [Gap]"
```

## Generation Algorithm

### Step 1: Domain Detection

Scan spec.md for indicators:

**UX Domain**:
- Keywords: UI, interface, design, accessibility, responsive, user experience
- Sections: Visual Design, Interactions, User Stories with UI focus

**API Domain**:
- Keywords: endpoint, REST, GraphQL, request, response, API
- Sections: API Endpoints, Data Schemas, Authentication

**Security Domain**:
- Keywords: authentication, authorization, encryption, PII, PHI, HIPAA, GDPR
- Sections: Security Requirements, Data Protection, Compliance

**Performance Domain**:
- Keywords: performance, speed, response time, scalability, load
- Sections: Non-Functional Requirements, Performance Metrics, SLAs

### Step 2: Requirement Extraction

For each domain, extract:
1. Requirement IDs (US-###, API-###, NFR-###)
2. Acceptance criteria (AC1, AC2, etc.)
3. Specific values mentioned
4. Vague terms used

### Step 3: Checklist Item Generation

For each requirement:

**Completeness Items**:
- Check if all necessary details present
- Target: 40% of items

**Clarity Items**:
- Identify vague terms ("fast", "user-friendly")
- Check if measurable criteria defined
- Target: 30% of items

**Consistency Items**:
- Check alignment with other requirements
- Verify pattern uniformity
- Target: 15% of items

**Coverage Items**:
- Identify missing edge cases
- Check error scenarios
- Target: 15% of items

### Step 4: Gap Identification

Compare spec against domain checklist template:
- Mark items with [?] for missing requirements
- These become explicit gaps to address

### Step 5: Priority Assignment

Implicit priority based on position:
1. Completeness and Gap items first (critical)
2. Clarity items second (important)
3. Consistency and Coverage items third (refinement)

---

- Focus on critical gaps

**Detailed**:
- 20-30 items per domain

### Domain Focus

**Auto-detect** (default):
- Scan spec and generate for detected domains

**Explicit**:
```bash

## Common Patterns by Domain

### UX Patterns

**Vague Visual Terms**:

**Missing Accessibility**:
- Always check WCAG 2.1 AA
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Color contrast ratios

**Responsive Gaps**:
- Breakpoints not defined
- Mobile-first not specified
- Touch targets too small

### API Patterns

**Incomplete Schemas**:

**Inconsistent Errors**:
- Different formats per endpoint
- Missing error codes
- Vague error messages

**Missing Standards**:
- No versioning strategy
- No pagination
- No rate limiting

### Security Patterns

**Vague Security Terms**:
- "Secure" → Specific encryption standards?
- "Protected" → Access controls defined?
- "Compliant" → Specific regulations mapped?

**Missing Controls**:
- Authentication without MFA
- Authorization without RBAC
- Encryption without key management

**Compliance Gaps**:
- HIPAA without BAA
- GDPR without data retention
- SOC2 without audit logs

### Performance Patterns

**Unmeasurable Terms**:
- "Fast" → Specific timing thresholds?
- "Scalable" → Concurrent user capacity?
- "Reliable" → Uptime SLA percentage?

**Missing Targets**:
- No percentile metrics (p95, p99)
- No throughput requirements
- No resource limits

## Integration Points

### Before: spec:specify

User creates feature specification with requirements.

### After: spec:plan

Once all checklist items validated, proceed to technical planning.

### Related: spec:validate

Checks cross-requirement consistency and dependency validation.

---

## Testing

Validate generated checklists:

```bash
# Check format
grep -E "^- \[[ X~?]\] CHK[0-9]{3} - .+\? \[.+\]" checklist.md

# Count items
grep -c "^- \[ \]" checklist.md

# Find gaps
grep "\[?\]" checklist.md

# Check references
grep -oE "Spec §[A-Z]+-[0-9]+" checklist.md
```

---

## Best Practices

### DO

- Generate checklists early (after spec:specify)
- Focus on requirement quality, not implementation
- Use specific, testable questions
- Link items to spec sections
- Iterate after spec updates

### DON'T

- Test implementation correctness
- Create vague meta-questions
- Skip gap identification
- Forget to update after spec changes
- Proceed to spec:plan with open gaps

---

## Troubleshooting

**Too many gap items**: Spec needs significant refinement before planning.

**All items complete**: Validate manually; may need more detailed checklist.

**No domains detected**: Spec may be too high-level; add specific requirements.

**Duplicate questions**: Merge related items; may indicate spec redundancy.
