## Technical Requirements

### Search Technology Decision

**Option 1: Elasticsearch (Recommended)**
- Pros: Fast, scalable, great full-text search
- Cons: Additional infrastructure, complexity
- [CLARIFY: Do we have infrastructure team support for Elasticsearch?]

**Option 2: PostgreSQL Full-Text Search**
- Pros: No new infrastructure, simpler
- Cons: Less powerful, may not scale to 100k+ products
- Good for MVP, can migrate to Elasticsearch later

**Recommendation: Start with PostgreSQL FTS, plan Elasticsearch migration**

### Performance Targets
- Search response: < 500ms (p95)
- Autocomplete response: < 100ms (p95)
- Index update: Real-time (within 5 seconds of product change)

### Database Changes
```ruby
# Migration needed
add_column :products, :search_vector, :tsvector
add_index :products, :search_vector, using: :gin
```

## Integration Points

**Existing Code Modifications:**
- ProductsController: Add search action
- Product model: Add search scope/method
- Products index view: Add search box
- Add search results view (or reuse index with query param)

**New Code:**
- Search service object (app/services/product_search.rb)
- Search form component
- Search results JavaScript (filtering, sorting)

**Analytics:**
- Track search queries (integrate with existing analytics)
- Monitor zero-result searches
- Track conversion from search

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **SEO**: Search results pages crawlable (/products?q=term)
- **Performance**: Cache popular searches (Redis)
- **Monitoring**: Alert if search response > 1 second
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation

## Out of Scope

- Visual/image search - future consideration
- Voice search - not applicable for desktop
- AI-powered recommendations - separate feature (Feature 015)
- Saved searches - deferred to v2

## Open Questions

1. [CLARIFY: Elasticsearch infrastructure support available?]
2. [CLARIFY: Autocomplete - popular searches or only product matches?]
3. [CLARIFY: Search analytics - Google Analytics or custom?]
4. [CLARIFY: Cache layer - Redis or Rails cache?]

## Dependencies

- None (all existing infrastructure)
- Optional: Elasticsearch if chosen over PostgreSQL FTS

## Migration Strategy

**Phase 1 (MVP): PostgreSQL Full-Text Search**
- Week 1: Implement basic search
- Week 2: Add filters and sorting
- Week 3: Autocomplete and polish

**Phase 2 (Future): Elasticsearch Migration**
- When product count > 100,000 or search performance degrades
- Zero-downtime migration with dual-write period
- A/B test performance before full cutover

## Success Metrics

- Search usage: > 30% of users per session
- Search success rate: < 10% zero-result searches
- Conversion: Search users convert 2x higher than non-search
- Performance: 95th percentile < 500ms

## Timeline Estimate

- Specification: Complete
- Planning: 3 hours
- Implementation: 1.5 weeks

## Example 4: API Feature - Rate Limiting

**User Request:**
"Add rate limiting to our REST API"

**Generated Spec (Abbreviated):**

```markdown
# Feature: API Rate Limiting

**Feature ID**: 019
**Priority**: P1 (Must Have)

## Problem Statement

Our API has no rate limiting, exposing us to abuse, DoS attacks, and
unfair resource consumption. We need tiered rate limits to protect
infrastructure while allowing legitimate usage.

## User Stories

### P1 (Must Have)

#### US19.1: Enforce Rate Limits
As an API operator, the system enforces rate limits per API key
so that no single client can overwhelm the service.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Rate limit: 100 requests/minute (free tier)
- [ ] Rate limit: 1000 requests/minute (paid tier)
- [ ] 429 status code when limit exceeded
- [ ] Retry-After header in response
- [ ] Rate limit headers in all responses:
  - X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
  - X-RateLimit-Remaining: 47
  - X-RateLimit-Reset: 1635724800

#### US19.2: Rate Limit by Endpoint
As an API operator, expensive endpoints have stricter limits
so that resource-intensive operations don't impact all users.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Default: 100 req/min
- [ ] Search endpoint: 30 req/min
- [ ] Report generation: 5 req/min
- [ ] Bulk operations: 10 req/min
- [ ] [CLARIFY: Should limits be per-endpoint or combined?]

## Technical Requirements

**Implementation:**
- Redis for distributed rate limiting
- Token bucket algorithm
- API key extracted from Authorization header

**Performance:**
- Rate limit check: < 10ms overhead per request
- Redis failover: Allow requests if Redis unavailable (fail open)

## Open Questions

1. [CLARIFY: Per-endpoint limits or combined total?]
2. [CLARIFY: Redis failover strategy - fail open or fail closed?]
3. [CLARIFY: IP-based rate limiting for non-authenticated requests?]

## Key Patterns Demonstrated

1. **Greenfield vs Brownfield**: Different context analysis approaches
2. **Priority Application**: P1/P2/P3 framework with clear criteria
3. **Clarification Tags**: Mark unknowns explicitly for follow-up
4. **Existing Code Integration**: Reference and build on current architecture
5. **Technical Decisions**: Document options and recommendations
6. **Scalability Considerations**: Performance targets and future migration
7. **Incomplete Requirements**: Generate spec with many [CLARIFY] tags when vague

See REFERENCE.md for complete spec template and field definitions.
