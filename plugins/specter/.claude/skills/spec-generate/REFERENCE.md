## Field Definitions

### Feature ID Format
- **Format**: Sequential 3-digit number (001, 002, 003, etc.)
- **Source**: Count existing features/ directories + 1
- **Padding**: Always 3 digits with leading zeros
- **Scope**: Per-project sequence (not global)

### Priority Levels

**P1 (Must Have)**:
- Criteria:
  - Core functionality required for MVP
  - Blocks other P1 features if not implemented
  - Critical user need or regulatory requirement
  - Non-negotiable for launch
- Examples:
  - User authentication for secure app
  - Payment processing for e-commerce
  - Data encryption for healthcare app

**P2 (Should Have)**:
- Criteria:
  - Important but can defer 1-2 sprints if needed
  - Significantly enhances UX but not critical
  - Competitive differentiator
  - High user value but workarounds exist
- Examples:
  - Password reset via email
  - Export data to CSV
  - Dark mode theme

**P3 (Nice to Have)**:
- Criteria:
  - Optional enhancements
  - Convenience features
  - Low implementation effort but low user impact
  - Future considerations
- Examples:
  - Profile theme customization
  - Keyboard shortcuts
  - Easter eggs

### User Story Format

**Structure**:
```
As a [specific user persona],
I can [specific action/capability]
so that [specific benefit/value].
```

**Good Examples**:
- "As a mobile user, I can view my order history offline so that I can reference past purchases without internet."
- "As an admin, I can bulk import users from CSV so that I can onboard teams efficiently."

**Bad Examples**:
- "As a user, I want a feature" (too vague)
- "The system should do X" (not user-centric)
- "Implement authentication" (task, not story)

### Acceptance Criteria Format

**Structure**:
- Checkbox list (- [ ])
- Specific, testable conditions
- Positive statements (what it does, not what it doesn't)
- Include edge cases and error conditions

**Good Examples**:
- "User receives password reset email within 60 seconds"
- "Search returns results in < 500ms for 95% of queries"
- "Upload fails gracefully with error message if file > 10MB"

**Bad Examples**:
- "Works correctly" (not specific)
- "Fast search" (not measurable)
- "Handles errors" (not detailed)

### [CLARIFY] Tag Usage

**When to Use**:
- Requirement is ambiguous or incomplete
- Multiple valid interpretations exist
- Technical decision needs stakeholder input
- Performance/scale expectations unspecified
- Business logic unclear

**Format**:
```markdown
[CLARIFY: Specific question requiring resolution?]
```

**Placement**:
- Inline within relevant section
- After related acceptance criteria
- In Open Questions section (aggregated)

**Examples**:
- `[CLARIFY: Password reset link expiry - 1 hour or 24 hours?]`
- `[CLARIFY: Concurrent session limit - 3, 5, or unlimited?]`
- `[CLARIFY: Search technology - Elasticsearch or PostgreSQL full-text?]`

```

## AskUserQuestion Patterns

### Clarifying Scope

```javascript
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "What is the scope of this feature?",
    "header": "Scope",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
      {
        "label": "Minimal MVP",
        "description": "Core functionality only, defer enhancements"
      },
      {
        "label": "Full Featured",
        "description": "Complete feature with all enhancements"
      },
      {
        "label": "Phased Approach",
        "description": "MVP now, enhancements in future phases"
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### Determining Priority

```javascript
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "What is the priority of this feature?",
    "header": "Priority",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
      {
        "label": "P1 (Must Have)",
        "description": "Critical for launch, blocks other work"
      },
      {
        "label": "P2 (Should Have)",
        "description": "Important but can defer if needed"
      },
      {
        "label": "P3 (Nice to Have)",
        "description": "Optional enhancement, low urgency"
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### Technology Choices

```javascript
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Which search technology should we use?",
    "header": "Technology",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
      {
        "label": "PostgreSQL FTS",
        "description": "Simpler, no new infrastructure, good for <100k items"
      },
      {
        "label": "Elasticsearch",
        "description": "Powerful, scalable, requires infrastructure setup"
      },
      {
        "label": "Algolia",
        "description": "Managed service, fast, cost scales with usage"
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### Integration Decisions

```javascript
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Which external integrations are required?",
    "header": "Integrations",
    "multiSelect": true,
    "options": [
      {
        "label": "JIRA",
        "description": "Create epics and stories in JIRA"
      },
      {
        "label": "Confluence",
        "description": "Publish specification to Confluence"
      },
      {
        "label": "Analytics",
        "description": "Track feature usage and metrics"
      },
      {
        "label": "None",
        "description": "No external integrations needed"
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

## Token Optimization Strategies

### Keep in SKILL.md (Core)
- YAML frontmatter (name, description, tools)
- What/When/How sections (brief)
- Execution flow (overview)
- Error handling (common cases)
- Output format (examples)
- Progressive disclosure references

### Move to EXAMPLES.md
- Concrete usage scenarios (5+ examples)
- Full spec.md outputs
- Different project types (greenfield, brownfield)
- Edge cases and variations
- Before/after comparisons

### Move to REFERENCE.md
- Complete template structure
- Field definitions
- Integration specifications
- Advanced patterns
- Technical implementation details
- API schemas

### Result
- SKILL.md: ~1,200 tokens (core guidance)
- EXAMPLES.md: ~2,500 tokens (scenarios)
- REFERENCE.md: ~3,000 tokens (technical)
- Total: ~6,700 tokens (was ~10,000+ in monolithic design)
- Lazy loading: Only SKILL.md loaded initially

## Validation Checklist

Before completing spec:generate:

- [ ] Feature ID assigned (sequential, 3 digits)
- [ ] Priority set (P1/P2/P3) with rationale
- [ ] Problem statement clear (2-4 sentences)
- [ ] User stories follow format (As/I can/so that)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria specific and testable
- [ ] [CLARIFY] tags used for ambiguities
- [ ] Technical requirements documented
- [ ] Integration points identified
- [ ] Out of scope explicitly stated
- [ ] Success metrics defined
- [ ] Timeline estimated
- [ ] Workflow state files updated
- [ ] External systems synced (if configured)

## Common Pitfalls

**Too Vague**:
- Problem: "Add search feature"
- Solution: Use AskUserQuestion to gather specifics

**Scope Creep**:
- Problem: Feature grows to include 20 user stories
- Solution: Focus on P1 MVP, defer P2/P3 to future

**Missing Context**:
- Problem: Spec doesn't reference existing code
- Solution: Always analyze brownfield projects first

**Unclear Priorities**:
- Problem: Everything marked P1
- Solution: Force-rank, use 60/30/10 rule (60% P1, 30% P2, 10% P3)

**Forgotten Clarifications**:
- Problem: Assumptions made without marking [CLARIFY]
- Solution: When in doubt, add [CLARIFY] tag
