- Current phase: Implementation (50% complete)

**Execution**:

```bash
# 1. Read current spec
Read features/001-user-auth/spec.md
→ Current user stories: 4 total
→ Current tasks: 23 total

# 2. Add new user story
Edit spec.md, append to User Stories section:
---
#### US1.5: User can log in with OAuth providers [P2]

**As a** user
**I want to** log in using Google, GitHub, or Microsoft accounts
**So that** I don't need to create another password

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] User sees "Sign in with Google" button
- [ ] User sees "Sign in with GitHub" button
- [ ] OAuth flow completes successfully
- [ ] User profile populated from OAuth provider
- [ ] User can link multiple OAuth accounts

**Priority**: P2 (Should Have)
**Estimate**: 8 story points
---

# 3. Check if plan needs update
Read features/001-user-auth/plan.md
→ Current: JWT-based authentication only
→ Needs: OAuth integration section

# 4. Update plan.md
Edit plan.md, add section:
---
### OAuth Integration

**Libraries**:
- passport (authentication middleware)
- passport-google-oauth20
- passport-github2
- passport-microsoft

**Flow**:
1. User clicks OAuth button
2. Redirect to provider authorization
3. Provider redirects back with auth code
4. Exchange code for access token
5. Fetch user profile
6. Create/update user in database
7. Issue JWT for session

**Security**:
- Verify state parameter (CSRF protection)
- Validate redirect URI
- Store minimal profile data
---

# 5. Add tasks to tasks.md
Edit tasks.md, add new tasks:
---

## Example 4: Incorporate Clarification Resolution

**User Request**: "Resolve the [CLARIFY] tags in the spec"

**Context**:
- Feature: 003-payment-processing
- Spec has 3 [CLARIFY] tags from spec:clarify
- Decisions made: escrow needed, Stripe chosen, PCI compliance required

**Execution**:

```bash
# 1. Read spec with clarifications
Read features/003-payment-processing/spec.md
→ Find [CLARIFY] tags with questions and decisions

# 2. Replace each [CLARIFY] with resolution
Edit spec.md:

Old:
---
[CLARIFY: Should we support escrow for marketplace transactions?
DECISION: Yes - add escrow for P2P sales to protect buyers/sellers
IMPACT: Adds escrow service integration, ~16 hours]
---

New:
---
**Escrow Support**: System will hold payment in escrow for P2P
marketplace transactions, releasing funds only after buyer confirms
receipt. Protects both buyers and sellers in peer-to-peer sales.
---

Old:
---
[CLARIFY: Which payment provider: Stripe, PayPal, or Braintree?
DECISION: Stripe - best API, lowest fees, team has experience
IMPACT: Use Stripe API, no impact on timeline]
---

---
**Payment Provider**: Stripe for payment processing. Provides best
developer experience, competitive fees (2.9% + $0.30), and team
has existing expertise.
---

Old:
---
[CLARIFY: PCI compliance required? Should we handle card data directly?
DECISION: No direct card handling - use Stripe Elements for PCI compliance
IMPACT: Use Stripe Elements, reduces compliance burden]
---

New:
---
**PCI Compliance**: Stripe Elements handles all card data, keeping
application PCI-DSS compliant without direct card storage or transmission.
---

# 3. Update plan.md with clarification decisions

## Example 5: Remove Deprecated Functionality

**User Request**: "Remove session-based auth, we're going JWT-only"

**Context**:
- Feature: 001-user-authentication
- Current phase: Implementation (30% complete)
- Tasks T005-T008 implement session-based auth (not yet started)
- Tasks T001-T004 implement JWT (already complete)

**Execution**:

```bash
# 1. Read current spec and tasks
Read features/001-user-auth/spec.md
→ Find: US1.6 "User session persists across browser restarts" [P2]

Read features/001-user-auth/tasks.md
→ Find: T005-T008 (session storage, session middleware, etc.)

# 2. Mark user story as deprecated
Edit spec.md:
---
#### ~~US1.6: User session persists across browser restarts~~ [DEPRECATED]

**Reason**: Moving to stateless JWT-only authentication. Session
persistence handled by client-side token storage instead.

**Deprecated**: 2025-10-31
**Replaced by**: JWT refresh tokens (US1.2)
---

# 3. Remove/update plan.md
Edit plan.md:
  Remove section: "Session Storage with Redis"
  Update section: "Authentication Flow" to JWT-only
  Add note about JWT refresh tokens

# 4. Handle affected tasks
Edit tasks.md:
  Mark as obsolete:
  - ~~T005: Set up Redis for session storage~~ [OBSOLETE]
  - ~~T006: Implement session middleware~~ [OBSOLETE]
  - ~~T007: Add session persistence logic~~ [OBSOLETE]
  - ~~T008: Write session tests~~ [OBSOLETE]

# 5. Update state files
Move from .specter-memory/CHANGES-PLANNED.md to CHANGES-COMPLETED.md:
---

## Common Patterns Summary

### Update Types

1. **Priority Shift**: Change P1 ↔ P2 ↔ P3, update task order
2. **MCP Integration**: Add JIRA/Confluence/Linear sync, store metadata
3. **Scope Addition**: Add user stories, update plan/tasks, log decision
4. **Clarification Resolution**: Replace [CLARIFY] tags, update downstream
5. **Scope Reduction**: Deprecate stories, obsolete tasks, save effort

### State Updates Required

All updates must:
- Edit spec.md with changes
- Check plan.md and tasks.md for impact
- Log decision in DECISIONS-LOG.md
- Update WORKFLOW-PROGRESS.md
- Update current-session.md
- Move tasks between CHANGES-PLANNED.md and CHANGES-COMPLETED.md

### When to Use Each Pattern

- **Priority shift**: User feedback, business priority change
- **MCP integration**: Team uses external tools, wants sync
- **Scope addition**: New requirements discovered during dev
- **Clarification resolution**: After spec:clarify completes
- **Scope reduction**: Feature cut, architecture simplification
