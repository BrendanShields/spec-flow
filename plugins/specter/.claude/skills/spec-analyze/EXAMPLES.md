# Spec Analyze - Examples

Concrete usage scenarios for the spec:analyze skill.

## Example 1: All-Green Validation

**Context**: Feature ready for implementation, no issues detected.

**Input**:
```bash
User: "Validate the authentication feature before I start coding"
Current feature: 001-user-authentication
Files exist: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md
```

**Skill Activation**:
```markdown
Trigger: "validate" + feature context
Loads: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md
Invokes: spec:analyzer
```

**Analysis Process**:
```markdown
1. Coverage check:
   - 4 user stories → 23 tasks (100% coverage)
   - 23 tasks → 4 stories (100% mapped)
   - 12 acceptance criteria → 19 tasks (100% addressed)

2. Priority alignment:
   - P1 stories (2) → P1 tasks (12) ✅
   - P2 stories (2) → P2 tasks (11) ✅

3. Blueprint compliance:
   - TDD required → Test tasks present ✅
   - Security checklist → Validation tasks present ✅

4. Consistency:
   - Terminology: "User" used consistently ✅
   - Components: All referenced in tasks ✅
```

**Output**:
```markdown

## Example 3: Priority Misalignment

**Context**: Task priorities don't match story importance.

**Input**:
```bash
Current feature: 003-payment-processing
Issue: P1 story has only P3 tasks
```

**Analysis Process**:
```markdown
1. Story priorities:
   - US3.1: Process payments (P1)
   - US3.2: Refund handling (P1)
   - US3.3: Payment history (P2)
   - US3.4: Export receipts (P3)

2. Task mapping:
   - US3.1 → T001(P3), T002(P3), T003(P3) ❌ CRITICAL
   - US3.2 → T004(P1), T005(P1) ✅
   - US3.3 → T006(P2), T007(P2) ✅
   - US3.4 → T008(P3) ✅
```

**Output**:
```markdown
# Analysis Report: Payment Processing

**Status**: ⚠️ Issues Found (1 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH)

## Issues by Severity

### CRITICAL Issues

| ID | Category | Issue | Location | Fix |
|----|----------|-------|----------|-----|
| C1 | Priority | P1 story has only P3 tasks | US3.1 | Increase T001-T003 to P1 |

## Metrics

### Priority Distribution
- P1 Stories: 2 → P1 Tasks: 2 (50% aligned) ❌
  - US3.1 misaligned: P1 story → P3 tasks
- P2 Stories: 1 → P2 Tasks: 2 (100% aligned) ✅
- P3 Stories: 1 → P3 Tasks: 1 (100% aligned) ✅

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (CRITICAL)
1. Update tasks.md: Change T001, T002, T003 from P3 to P1
   - These implement core payment processing (US3.1)
   - Cannot defer - required for release

## Next Steps

Manually edit features/003-payment-processing/tasks.md
Change task priorities, then re-run spec:analyze
```

**User Experience**:
```
❌ CRITICAL: Priority mismatch blocks implementation
→ Fix T001-T003 priorities in tasks.md
```

## Example 4: Blueprint Violations

**Context**: Architecture blueprint defines mandatory patterns not followed.

**Input**:
```bash
Current feature: 004-user-notifications
Blueprint: TDD required (MUST), API versioning (MUST)
Tasks: No test tasks, no versioning tasks
```

**Analysis Process**:
```markdown
1. Blueprint compliance:
   - MUST: Test-Driven Development
     → Search tasks for "test", "spec", "TDD"
     → Found: 0 test tasks ❌ CRITICAL

   - MUST: API versioning
     → Search tasks for "version", "v1", "api"
     → Found: 0 versioning tasks ❌ CRITICAL

   - SHOULD: Security review
     → Found: 1 security task ✅
```

**Output**:
```markdown
# Analysis Report: User Notifications

**Status**: ⚠️ Issues Found (2 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH)

## Issues by Severity

### CRITICAL Issues

| ID | Category | Issue | Location | Fix |
|----|----------|-------|----------|-----|
| C1 | Blueprint | TDD required, no test tasks | tasks.md | Add TDD tasks for all components |
| C2 | Blueprint | API versioning required | tasks.md | Add versioning implementation |

## Metrics

### Blueprint Compliance
- MUST Principles: 3 (1 compliant = 33%) ❌
  - TDD: Not compliant (0 test tasks)
  - API versioning: Not compliant (0 tasks)
  - Security: Compliant ✅
- SHOULD Principles: 2 (2 compliant = 100%) ✅

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (CRITICAL)
1. Add test tasks following TDD:
   - Write tests before implementation for each component
   - Minimum: Unit tests for service layer
   - Recommended: Integration tests for API

2. Add API versioning tasks:
   - Implement /v1/notifications endpoint structure
   - Add version middleware
   - Document versioning strategy

## Next Steps

CRITICAL issues block implementation - must fix first:
1. Update tasks.md with test tasks
2. Update tasks.md with versioning tasks
3. Re-run spec:analyze to verify compliance
```

**User Experience**:
```
❌ CRITICAL: Blueprint violations detected
→ Add TDD and versioning tasks before proceeding
```

## Example 5: Terminology Inconsistencies

**Context**: Same concept called different names across documents.

**Analysis Process**:
```markdown
1. Terminology scan:
   - spec.md: "User" (15 occurrences)
   - plan.md: "Account" (8 occurrences), "User" (3 occurrences)
   - tasks.md: "Member" (5 occurrences), "User" (10 occurrences)

2. Detect variations:
   - Concept: Authenticated person
   - Variants: "User", "Account", "Member" ❌ MEDIUM

3. Impact:
   - Code confusion: UserService vs AccountService?
   - Database: users table vs accounts table?
   - API: /users vs /accounts endpoints?
```

**Output**:
```markdown
# Analysis Report: User Management

**Status**: ⚠️ Issues Found (0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH, 1 MEDIUM)

## Issues by Severity

### MEDIUM Issues

| ID | Category | Issue | Location | Fix |
|----|----------|-------|----------|-----|
| M1 | Consistency | "User"/"Account"/"Member" used inconsistently | Multiple | Standardize to one term |

## Metrics

### Consistency
- Terminology Variations: 3 detected
  - "User": spec.md (15), plan.md (3), tasks.md (10)
  - "Account": plan.md (8)
  - "Member": tasks.md (5)

## Detailed Findings

### Terminology Analysis

**Recommendation**: Standardize on "User" (most common in spec)

**Required Changes**:
1. plan.md: Replace 8 instances of "Account" with "User"
2. tasks.md: Replace 5 instances of "Member" with "User"

**Affected Areas**:
- Component names: AccountService → UserService
- Database: accounts table → users table
- API endpoints: /accounts → /users
- Variable names: currentAccount → currentUser

## Recommendations

### Optional Enhancements (MEDIUM)
1. Standardize terminology to "User" across all documents
2. Update component names for consistency
3. Consider creating glossary in .specter/

## Next Steps

Optional but recommended:
1. Run spec:update to fix terminology in spec/plan
2. Manually update tasks.md
3. Re-run spec:analyze to verify
```

**User Experience**:
```
⚠️  1 MEDIUM issue: Terminology inconsistent
→ Optional: Standardize to "User"
→ OK to proceed if desired
```
