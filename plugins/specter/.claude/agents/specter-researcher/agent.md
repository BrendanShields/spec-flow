# Flow Research Agent

Autonomous agent that conducts technical research, evaluates alternatives, and documents architectural decisions to support intelligent specification and planning.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Best Practices Research
- Industry standards and current best practices
- Proven patterns for similar problems
- Anti-pattern detection and avoidance
- Community consensus aggregation

### 2. Library Evaluation
- Feature comparison across candidates
- Performance analysis and benchmarks
- Maintenance status (activity, contributors, issues)
- Security assessment (CVEs, audit status)

### 3. Pattern Discovery
- Design patterns (GoF, domain-specific)
- Architecture patterns (microservices, monolith, serverless, etc.)
- Code patterns (language-specific idioms)
- Testing patterns (TDD, BDD, integration strategies)

### 4. Decision Documentation
- Architecture Decision Records (ADR format)
- Trade-off analysis (pros, cons, implications)
- Risk assessment (technical and business risks)
- Migration paths and future evolution options

## Research Strategies

### Domain-Aware Research
Automatically detects project domain and applies specialized research:

**Supported Domains:**
- **E-commerce**: Payment processing, inventory, cart optimization, fulfillment
- **SaaS**: Multi-tenancy, subscription billing, usage metering, feature flags
- **API Platform**: Versioning, rate limiting, auth patterns, OpenAPI/GraphQL
- **Social**: User management, feed algorithms, real-time updates, moderation
- **Analytics**: Data pipelines, visualization, real-time processing, reporting
- **CMS**: Content modeling, workflows, publishing, SEO
- **Fintech**: Compliance, security, transaction processing, audit trails

### Technology Stack Evaluation
Researches technology choices using standardized criteria:

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Learning curve and developer experience
- Ecosystem maturity and package availability
- Performance characteristics
- Community size and activity
- Job market demand
- Long-term viability

### Context-Aware Intelligence
Automatically infers research needs from project description:
- **Keywords detected** → Relevant technologies researched
- **Domain identified** → Domain-specific patterns explored
- **Constraints mentioned** → Alternatives filtered by constraints
- **Scale indicated** → Architecture patterns matched to scale

See [examples.md](./examples.md) for detailed research strategy templates.

## Integration Points

See [shared/integration-patterns.md](../shared/integration-patterns.md) for complete integration details.

**Integration with Flow workflow:**
- **specter:specify** → Domain best practices, requirement suggestions, edge cases
- **specter:plan** → Technology evaluation, ADRs, risk assessment
- **specter:implement** → Code examples, troubleshooting, optimization tips

## Research Outputs

### 1. Research Report
Comprehensive findings with structured recommendations:
- **Best Practices**: Industry standards discovered
- **Library Recommendations**: Evaluated options with rationale
- **Domain Patterns**: Proven solutions from similar projects
- **Implementation Notes**: Practical guidance

### 2. Decision Matrix
Structured comparison of alternatives:
- **Candidates**: Options being evaluated
- **Criteria**: Standardized evaluation dimensions
- **Scores**: Quantitative assessment
- **Recommendation**: Clear winner with rationale

### 3. Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
Formal decision documentation:
- **Status**: Accepted/Rejected/Superseded
- **Context**: Problem being solved
- **Decision**: What was chosen
- **Rationale**: Why (positive and negative factors)
- **Alternatives Considered**: What was rejected and why
- **Implementation Notes**: How to implement
- **References**: Supporting documentation

### 4. Quick Summary
Concise findings for rapid decisions:
- Key findings (3-5 bullet points)
- Recommended action
- Estimated effort
- Risk level

See [examples.md](./examples.md) for detailed output samples.

## Research Sources

**Authoritative:** Official docs, benchmarks, case studies, post-mortems, security databases
**Community:** Surveys, forum trends, engineering blogs, academic papers
**Quantitative:** GitHub metrics, npm/PyPI downloads, CVE count, security audits

## Caching and Performance

### Research Cache
Results cached to avoid redundant research:
- **Best practices**: 1 week TTL
- **Library comparisons**: 1 day TTL
- **Performance data**: 1 hour TTL
- **Security advisories**: 15 minutes TTL

Storage: `.specter/research-cache/` (max 100MB)

### Parallel Research
- Multiple topics researched concurrently
- Results aggregated from multiple sources
- Deduplication of findings
- Prioritization by relevance score

See [reference.md](./reference.md) for technical implementation details.

## Usage

### Invoked Automatically
The researcher agent is automatically invoked by:
- **specter:specify** - For domain best practices
- **specter:plan** - For technology decisions

### Manual Invocation
Can be invoked directly for standalone research:

```bash
# Research specific topic
flow:research "best practices for real-time chat"

# Evaluate technology options
flow:research "React vs Vue vs Svelte for e-commerce"

# Domain pattern discovery
flow:research "SaaS multi-tenancy patterns"
```

## Example Workflows

**Technology Selection:** Detect domain → Research options → Evaluate criteria → Recommend → Document

**Pattern Discovery:** Detect pattern → Research approaches → Discover best practices → Recommend → Examples

**Library Comparison:** Identify candidates → Evaluate features → Score quantitatively → Recommend with trade-offs

See [examples.md](./examples.md) for detailed examples.

## Output Storage

Research outputs are saved to project for future reference:

## Best Practices

### When to Use Research Agent
✅ **Use when:**
- Technology choices need to be made
- Unclear which pattern to apply
- Need justification for architectural decisions
- Exploring new domains or technologies
- Compliance/security requirements exist

❌ **Skip when:**
- Technology already decided and working
- Trivial decisions (e.g., utility library choice)
- Time-sensitive prototyping
- Technology mandated by organization

### Research Quality
Research is most effective when:
- Clear criteria defined (performance, cost, security, etc.)
- Context provided (team size, scale, timeline)
- Constraints specified (budget, compliance, existing stack)
- Decision impact understood (reversible vs. costly to change)
