## What Was Fixed

### Previous Documentation Issues

The previous README.md and MIGRATION guide described a **completely different v3.0**:

**❌ Incorrect (Old Docs)**:
- `/👻` emoji command as primary interface
- Team collaboration features (locks, assignments, master-spec)
- 84% token reduction
- 8 commands → 1 command consolidation
- Team dashboard and locking mechanisms
- JSON state as primary (markdown as secondary)

**✅ Correct (New Docs)**:
- `/spec` hub command as primary interface
- Individual developer workflow (no team features in v3.0)
- 81% token reduction (actual measured)
- 13 commands → `/spec` hub with subcommands
- Progressive disclosure and state caching
- Markdown state as primary (JSON optional for future)

### Alignment with Actual Implementation

Documentation now accurately reflects:

1. **Actual Skills Created**:
   - spec:init, spec:generate, spec:plan, spec:tasks, spec:implement (core 5)
   - spec:clarify, spec:blueprint, spec:update, spec:orchestrate (supporting 4)
   - spec:analyze, spec:discover, spec:checklist, spec:metrics (utilities 4)

2. **Actual Token Reduction**:
   - Measured: 81% average reduction (6,800 → 1,283 tokens)
   - Not the 84% from placeholder docs

3. **Actual Architecture**:
   - Progressive disclosure (3-tier: metadata → core → resources)
   - State caching (hub reads once, passes to skills)
   - Shared resources (integration-patterns, workflow-patterns, state-management)
   - YAML frontmatter in all skills

4. **Actual Command Interface**:
   - `/spec` hub command (not emoji)
   - Context-aware routing
   - Subcommands: `/spec init`, `/spec generate`, etc.
   - Progressive flags: `--examples`, `--reference`, `--verbose`
